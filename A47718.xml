            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Can do no leſs than acquaint thee, That the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Part of the REPORTS of that Learned Lawyer, <hi>William Leonard,</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> Eſquire, were obtained from me, and Printed by the over-forwardneſs of thoſe perſons that received it from my hand, who publiſhed it with a Deſign to prejudice the Learned Author and my ſelf, by falſe Intimating in the Epiſtle to the Reader prefixed before the <hi>Second Part,</hi> That the Firſt and Second Part, was [All] of our Learned Authors Works, [that I thought fit to publiſh.] That I may Extricate my ſelf out of their intended Abuſe, and undeceive thee, I do hereby aſſure thee, That although I do Collect the Firſt and Second Part, yet do I wholly diſown the Epiſtle afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and alſo aver it to be a falſe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Aſſertion. That it is ſo, I refer thee to the View of this <hi>Third Part,</hi> The which is in no wiſe Inferior to the Firſt and Second Part: But on the contrary, I may with Modeſty ſay, as to the Worth and Uſefulneſs of it, That it may Challenge the Precedence of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Two; the which I intended, as one that Feaſteth his Gueſts, preſerveth the Daintieſt Diſhes until the laſt.</p>
            <p>My Intention ever was, (if my other occaſions would give me leave) To publiſh ſuch further CASES as were Collected by him, (not before Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed) that might add ſomething to the Study and Benefit of the Ingenuous Reader: Wherefore I having
<pb facs="tcp:99485:3"/>
lately Collected (out of his Manuſcript which only is in my hands) ſome other Caſes (out of many) which lay ſcattering therein, not before made Publick, I have reduced them into this Third Part, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thy Reading, and leave to thy favourable Conſtruction. And if theſe Caſes now Printed off in this Third Part, (as the former Caſes have done) ſhall find good Acceptance of thee, and be uſeful to thee, I ſhall willingly (if God give me life, and it be deſired,) put an End to this Work. In the proſecution of the which, I ſhall have due regard, as I hitherto have had in this Third Part, as well as in the Two former Parts, that thou ſhalt be preſented with nothihg but what is Really uſeful, and not to be had in other Works of the like nature.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as no Action or Thing done under Heaven, can be free from Error, in a greater or leſſer proportion, The which, as well as other Arts, Printing too too frequently demonſtrateth; yet the Errors of this Third Part are ſo few, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that it maketh me the more Confident to deſire thy favourable Corection: Therefore I leave it to thee.</p>

that during the poſſeſſion of the Grandfather, the Warranty is but ſuſpended, and not determined: and although that by the death of the Grandfather it be determined; yet having reſpect to the Leſſee, it is in being; for his Eſtate is derived out of the Eſtate which was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and which deſcends with the Warranty. <hi>Bendloes,</hi> One cannot make Title by a Collateral Warranty only, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>AN Action upon the Caſe was brought, for ſtopping of a Way; The Plaintiff declared, That the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a Houſe in <hi>D.</hi> and Leaſed the ſame to the Plaintiff for life; And that the ſaid Duke, and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate, &amp;c. have uſed time out of mind, &amp;c. to have a Way over the Lands of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant unto the Park of <hi>D.</hi> to carry and recarry Wood neceſſary for the ſame Houſe, from the ſaid Park to the ſame Houſe; and further declared, That the Defendant <hi>Obſtupavit</hi> the Way. It was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Carns,</hi> That upon this matter, no Action upon the Caſe lieth, but an Aſſiſe, becauſe that the Freehold of the Houſe is in the Plaintiff; and alſo the Freehold of the Land over which, &amp;c. is in the Defendant: But if the Plaintiff or Defendant had but an Eſtate for years, &amp;c. then an Action upon the Caſe would lie, and not an Aſſiſe: All which was granted by the Court.<note place="margin">Poſt. 263.</note> It was alſo holden, That this word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Obſtupavit,</hi> was ſufficient in it ſelf; <hi>ſcil.</hi> without ſhewing the ſpecial matter how; as by ſetting up any Gate, Hedge or Ditch, &amp;c. for <hi>Obſtupavit</hi> implyes a Nuſans conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and not a perſonal diſturbance, as a Foreſtaller, or in ſaying to the Plaintiff upon the Land, &amp;c. that he ſhould not go there, or uſe that Way; for in ſuch caſes, an Action upon the Caſe lieth. But as to any local or real diſturbance, <hi>Obſtupavit</hi> amounts to <hi>Obſtruxit:</hi> And although in the Declaration is ſet down the day and the year of the Obſtruction, yet it ſhall not be intended, that it continued but the ſame day: for the words of the Declaration are further, by which he was diſturbed of his Way, and yet is; and ſo the continuance of the diſturbance is alledged: And of ſuch Opinion alſo was the whole Court. <hi>Leonard,</hi> Prothonotary, ſaid to the Court, That he had declared of a Preſcription, <hi>habere viam tam pedeſtrem quam equeſtrem, pro omnibus &amp; omnimodis Cariagiis,</hi> and by that Preſcription he could not have a Cart-way, for every Preſcription is <hi>ſtricti juris. Dyer,</hi> That is well Obſerved, and I conceive that the Law is ſo; and therefore it is good to preſcribe, <hi>habere viam pro omnibus Cariagiis,</hi> generally, without ſpeaking of Horſe-way or Cart-way, or other Way, &amp;c.</p>

And he inſiſted much in his Argument upon this point, That Vſes limited upon any Conveyance, are governed and directed according to the Rules of the Common Law: As if a Feoffment in Fee be made unto the uſe of another for life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the uſe of the Leſſee for life, and the Heirs of his body, &amp;c. now the party hath an eſtate tail executed in poſſeſſion, and that is according to the Rule of the Common Law.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99485:17"/>
manner than according to the Rules of the Common Law, there they ſhall not be ruled and governed by the Rules of the Common Law: As if Lands be given to the uſe of one for life, and to the uſe of ſuch Leſſees to whom the Tenant for life ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the ſame for years or life, rendring Rent, the remainder over to a ſtranger in tail, and afterwards the Tenant for life makes a Leaſe for years, or life, and dieth; ſuch a Leaſe ſhall bind him in the remainder, although that the Leſſor had not but for life, and be now dead: for the Vſe limited here to the Leſſees, which would be, was limited contrary to the Rules of the Common Law. For by the Common Law, ſuch Leaſes made by Tenant for life, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by his death: And in this Caſe, This Leaſe for <hi>20</hi> years, after the death of the Grantor, was limited according to the Rules of the Common Law, and therefore it ſhall take effect accordingly, as if it had paſſed in poſſeſſion, and not in uſe, as if the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had been of the Land it ſelf, and that Land had been granted to the Grantor for <hi>20</hi> years after his death, that Intereſt had been veſted in him to ſell, forfeit, or otherwiſe to diſpoſe at his pleaſure, and ſhall not accrue to the Executors as a purchaſe. <hi>19 E. 2.

life, and if the Leſſee died within the Term of <hi>20</hi> years, that his Executors or Aſſigns ſhould have it until the end of the ſaid <hi>20</hi> years, and a <hi>Quid juris clamat</hi> was brought againſt the Leſſee for life without any mention of any other Eſtate. To which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded the ſpecial matter, and demanded Iudgment upon that Fine, if he ſhould be driven to Attorn, where he is ſuppoſed Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life only; And it is there ſaid, That that ſpecial matter is but a Proteſtation to ſave the Term to his Executors. And upon ſuch a Fine, ſuch Tenant hath been driven to Attorn: And by <hi>Dyer,</hi> If the Leſſee doth not make ſuch proteſtation, yet his ſpecial intereſt is not impaired by it; yet it is but reaſon that it be entred for the more manifeſtation of it. <hi>32 E. 3. Quid juris clamat, 5.</hi> A Leaſe to <hi>W.</hi> for life, and <hi>20</hi> years over, he may grant the ſame Term or any part of it: And he cited the Caſe between <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Gravenor, 3. &amp; 4 <hi>Mar.</hi> Dyer, 150.</hi> Where a Leaſe for life was made, and by the Indenture of Leaſe <hi>Proviſum fuit,</hi> That if the Leſſee died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Term of <hi>60</hi> years, that then his Executors and Aſſigns ſhould have and enjoy the ſaid Lands <hi>pro termino totidem annorum,</hi> which did amount to the number of <hi>60</hi> years, to be accompted from the date of the Indenture. And it was the Opinion of the Court, That that was not any Leaſe: But they all agreed, That a Leaſe for years in remainder might be upon a Leaſe for life in the ſame perſon. <hi>See 40 E. 3.</hi> A Leaſe was made for life, and half a year after; the Leſſee died, and Waſte is brought againſt the Executors, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Teſtator held for years; and the Writ was holden good: And there it is ſaid by <hi>Kirton,</hi> That the Executors could not have that Term, unleſs it were in the Teſtator; and there the Term is not limited to any perſon. And <hi>ſee 11 H. 4. 187.</hi> Annuity granted to one for life, and <hi>20 years</hi> after. And <hi>50 E. Aſſ. 1.</hi> A Leaſe for life, and <hi>3</hi> years over to his Executors. And then here in our Caſe, This Vſe being limited in Order, according to the Rules of the Common Law, ſhall veſt in the Grantor to give or forfeit, and then by the Attainder it was forfeited to Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> and if ſo, then the Plaintiff ſhall be barred. <hi>Harper,</hi> Iuſtice, to the contrary; And that the Intereſt in the Remainder for years limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Executors and Aſſigns of the Grantor is in abeyance, and not in the Grantor, and then it cannot be forfeited: But if this Vſe had been limited to the Grantor himſelf, then all had been in him to give, &amp;c. But here in our Caſe, the Remainder for years is limited and appointed to the Executors, &amp;c. Alſo, Vſes ſhall not be ruled in ſuch manner as Lands; but the Law ſhall rule the poſſeſſion obtained by uſe in another manner, than the poſſeſſion obtained by the Order of the Common Law: As in the Caſe of <hi>Amy Townſend, Plow. Com. 111, 112.</hi> Where the Husband ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the right of his Wife, made a Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of himſelf and his Wife for life, with divers remainders over; Now is not the Wife remitted, as ſhe ſhould be by Conveyance at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon La: as if the Husband diſcontinueth the Land in the right
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99485:18"/>
of his Wife, and the Diſcontinuee giveth the Lands to the Husband and Wife, and to a third perſon, ſhe is remitted to the whole, and the third perſon hath not any thing. <hi>Dyer,</hi> to the ſame intent; And here we ought to intend and conſider, That it was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to advance his Executors with this Term unto their own uſe and benefit, and not to leave the ſame in himſelf. And I do conceive, That the uſe is in abeyance until the Executors are made, or an Aſſignee appointed; for he may make an Aſſignee who ſhall have the Term: For Aſſignee may be made two ways, <hi>1</hi> By grant of an Eſtate which is in the Grantor before; <hi>2</hi> A perſon nominated and appointed by another to take any thing, &amp;c. And it ſhall be alſo intended, That <hi>Cranmer</hi> was purpoſed to make other Proviſion to leave to his Executors Aſſets to perform his Will; and not that that Term ſhould be applyed to that purpoſe, for then he would have ſhewed it in the Conveyance by words; <hi>ſcil.</hi> as to pay his Legacies, and perform his laſt Will: And the Caſes put by my Brother <hi>Manwood,</hi> do not go to the Point; For I agree, Where Lands are given to one for life, the remainder for years, and doth not ſay to whom, it cannot be intended to any other but to the Leſſee for life; or otherwiſe it ſhall be void. And alſo where Land is given to one for life, and for two years after to his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Aſſigns, or Heirs, all is in the Leſſee, for all is as one gift: But where it is given to one for life, and after his death, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to his Executors, I do not ſee any reaſon that that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhould be any Aſſets in the hands of the Executors; Or that if the Leſſee dieth Inteſtate, that his Adminiſtrator ſhould have it; and therefore the Executors ſhall have the ſame as a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe: But <hi>Cranmer</hi> might have given the ſame, or appointed one in the mean time to receive it, and in the mean time it ſhall be in abeyance. Alſo if Lands be Leaſed to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for years to his Heirs, the ſame remainder for years is in abey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance until the death of the Leſſee, and then it ſhall veſt in the Heir as a Purchaſor, and as a Chattel, and ſhall go to the Executor of the Heir, &amp;c. and the Tenant for life cannot meddle with it, for it is not in him: Alſo, Vſes ſhall not be raiſed as Lands; <hi>i.e</hi> at the Common Law, but ſhall be raiſed by the Statute, and as Vſes were raiſed in the Chancery before the Statute. And therefore if this Conveyance had been before the Statute, he could not have compelled the Feoffees to diſpoſe of that Intereſt at his pleaſure, &amp;c. And then <hi>Cranmer</hi> the Son ſhall have the Land by force of the entail limited unto him; For the Eſtate for years is gone, becauſe no aſſignment of it is made, nor any Executors who can take it, and the Eſtate for life is determined by the death of <hi>Cranmer;</hi> and the Feoffee to an Vſe cannot have it, for there is not any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof he ſhould have any Vſe; for by the Limitation, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was left in the Feoffee: And ſo I conceive, that the Plaintiff ſhall recover.

                     </note> This Caſe was moved to the Iuſtices in the Court of the Kings Bench: A Man had Iſſue two Daughters by divers Women; and being ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, he made his Will, and by the ſame Deviſed, That his Wife ſhould have the moyety of his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99485:20"/>
Lands for years, and that his eldeſt Daughter at the day of her Marriage, ſhould enter into the other moyety; his eldeſt Daughter married and died without Iſſue: And the Queſtion was, Whether her Vncle ſhould have that moyety or the fourth part of the whole Land. <hi>Catline</hi> conceived, and ſaid, That when the Deviſe which was made to the eldeſt Daughter, that ſhe might enter after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain years, is not the Inheritance in her preſently, and the other words void? So he ſaid here, That it is not a purchaſe in the eldeſt Daughter, but both the Daughters ſhould enter in Common as one Heir to their Father, until the Marriage; and then the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which was once ſettled in them, ſhould not be removed. <hi>Southcote,</hi> Iuſtice, ſaid, There are no words of Limitation of any Eſtate that the Daughter ſhould have after the Marriage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deviſe was void; and if he had limited, that the Daughter after Marriage ſhould have it for life, the Fee-ſimple is veſted in her before, and then ſhe cannot have it for life. And he ſaid, That if a Leaſe be made to the eldeſt Daughter for years by the Father, and afterwards the Land deſcends to her and her Siſter, as unto one moyety of the Land, the Leaſe is determined, but not as to the other moyety. <hi>Whiddon,</hi> Iuſtice, Where a Deviſe is for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a ſtranger, there the Heir ſhall take by the Deviſe, and not by deſcent. As if a Leaſe be made for years, the remainder to the Heir, there the Heir ſhall take the Land by the Deviſe. <hi>Catline,</hi> She hath it be Deſcent, and not by the Deviſe. But if he deviſeth the Land to the Heir in tail, with this, That he ſhall pay a certain ſum of Mony unto another, there the Heir ſhall take by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, for the benefit which may accrue to the ſtranger, and not by deſcent, for otherwiſe the Will ſhould not be performed: But where the Eſtate of the Heir is altered by the Will, nor any benefit doth accrue unto another after that the Lands come to the hands of the Heir; in that caſe he ſhall have the Land by deſcent: And ſo here in this caſe for as much as the Deviſe is, That the Daughter ſhall enter, they both being but one Heir to their Father, ſhall have the Land by deſcent; and the words of the Will, <hi>That he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the moiety,</hi> ſhall be void; as, if the Deviſe had been to the Heir for life, there the ſame is void, becauſe the Fee-ſimple which deſcendeth to her, doth drown the particular eſtate for life. And therefore in the principal caſe here, the Vncle ſhall have but the moyety of the moyety which is ſo deviſed, and the other Siſter ſhall have the other moyety of the Land; and as to that moyety which is deviſed to the Wife for years, the ſame ſhall enure according to the Common Law, that the Vncle ſhall have the moyety of that; and the other Siſter the other moyety.</p>

                  <p>THis Caſe was moved to the Court by <hi>Lovelace,</hi> Serjeant; A Man Covenants with another to make and execute an eſtate of ſuch Lands as ſhould deſcend to him from his Father and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father by a certain day, the ſame Lands to be of the clear yearly value of 40 Marks: And the Queſtion which he moved to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, was, That if the party had more Lands which came to him from his Grandfather and Father, than did amount to the yearly value of 40 Marks, If he was to make aſſurance of all the Lands, or of ſo much thereof only as amounted to the value of 40 Marks? And <hi>Manwood,</hi> Iuſtice, conceived, That he ſhould make aſſurance of Lands only which were of the value of 40 Marks <hi>per annum:</hi> For the words <hi>(ſuch which)</hi> do not go ſo largely as if he had ſaid, <hi>All my Lands which ſhall deſcend, or to me be deſcended;</hi> for then the yearly value were but a demonſtration, and all his Lands ought to be aſſured. But here the Intent of the Indenture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken otherwiſe, than to have but an Aſſurance of ſo much Land; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch Lands and Tenements as were my Grandfathers, and Fathers, amounting to 40 Marks by the year:</hi> for there by thoſe words, he ſhall have but 40 Marks by the year. <hi>Lovelace,</hi> It hath been taken, That where the Queen made a Leaſe of all her Lands in ſuch a Town, amounting to the yearly value of 40 <hi>l.</hi> that that valuation is not a demonſtration, and ſhall not abridge the Grant precedent, to have all in the Town which ſhould be of the value of 40 <hi>l.</hi> but her Grant ſhall be taken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued according to the words precedent. <hi>Manwood,</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe of aſſurance upon a ſettlement of Marriage is, That he ſhall ſtand ſeiſed of ſo much of his Land as ſhall be of the clear year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value of 40 Marks; If the marriage take effect, The Queſtion hath been, If they to whom the aſſurance is made, may enter into any part of the Land at their election, and take that which is the beſt Land, to the value of 40 Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> and hold the ſame in ſeveralty, or if they ſhall be only Tenants in Common with the other? And alſo it hath been a Queſtion, Whether they may chooſe one Acre in one place, and another Acre in another place, and ſo through the whole Land where they pleaſe, becauſe the Grant ſhall be taken ſtrong againſt him that granteth: But I conceive, that it ſhould be a hard caſe to make ſuch Election of Acres. But it was ſaid by ſome Serjeant at the Bar, That if a Man grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to another to take 20 Trees in his Lands, that the Grantee may cut down one Tree in one place, and another in another place: <hi>Manwood</hi> agreed that Caſe: but of the other Caſe, the Court doubted of it.

                  <p>THis Caſe was moved by <hi>Meade,</hi> Serjeant to the Iuſtices of the Court of Common Pleas, <hi>viz.</hi> That Sir <hi>Peter Philpot</hi> Knight, ſeiſed in Fee of divers Mannors and Lands, ſuffered a Recovery, and made a Feoffment thereof unto divers perſons, To the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder to his right Heirs: And after the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>of Wills,</hi> He deviſed all his ſaid Mannors and Land to his Wife for life; and it was expreſſed in his Will, That he could not deviſe all his Lands, by reaſon of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that his Will was, That his Wife ſhould have ſo much which might be deviſed by the Laws of the Land: And there was another Clauſe in the ſaid Will, That his Feoffees ſhould ſtand ſeiſed of the ſame Mannors and Lands after the death of his Wife, To the uſe of one <hi>Hurlock</hi> and others for years, for the payment of his Debts, and for the raiſing of Portions for the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Daughters in Marriage: And further by his ſaid Will he willed, That if the Law would not bear it, That <hi>Hurlock</hi> and the others ſhould have the Intereſt, Then he willed that his Son ſhould have all his Mannors and Lands, and ſhould pay his Debts, and ſhould give certain ſums of Monies for the Marriage Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Daughters; And the Queſtion which was moved to the Court, was, Whether the firſt part of his Will, That is to ſay, That <hi>Hurlock</hi> and the others ſhould have his Lands, &amp;c. were void, or not, by the later words of his Will? <hi>Dyer,</hi> Iuſtice, ſaid, That the laſt words of the Will did well expound the meaning of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99485:21"/>
the firſt words, and that the Will ſhould be performed as it might be: And afterwards <hi>Harper</hi> ſaid, That upon this matter, <hi>Hurlock</hi> and the others had had a Decree in the Court of Wards, to have the whole Lands during the years, and not two parts of the Lands only. <hi>Dyer,</hi> Iuſtice, ſaid, That the Will of Sir <hi>Tho. Umpton,</hi> which was made mean between the Statutes of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>and</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and which is excepted by the ſame Statute, that it ſhould not be conſtrued in other form than according to the firſt Statute was, Of all his Lands. And upon a Demurrer argued, It was adjudged, That the Will was good of two parts, although that by the Will it was not divided: For where a Man hath a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to do a thing, and he doth it, and more, ſo as he exceeds his Warrant, yet it is good for that part for which it is warranted; and void for the reſt: As if a Man makes a Warrant of Attorny to make Livery and Seiſin of the Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> and he makes Livery of the Mannors of <hi>Dale</hi> and <hi>Sale;</hi> it is good for the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Dale,</hi> and void for the Mannor of <hi>Sale.</hi> The Caſe was, in a Writ of Partition: And afterwards the Record was removed by a Writ of Error, ſuppoſing that this Court had Erred; and the Iudgment was affirmed by three of the Iuſtices of the Kings Bench. But becauſe there was a Diſcontinuance in the Record, which was erronious, for that the firſt Iudgment was reverſed, but not for any other cauſe. And ſuch was the meaning and intent of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. before the making of the Statute of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>of Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wills.</hi> And therefore here in the principal Caſe, it was holden, That the Will was good for two parts, both to the Wife, and alſo to <hi>Hurlock</hi> and the others. And it was holden, That by the Intent of the Will, that the Son was to pay ſuch ſums of Monies a <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> was to have paid, ſo as the Will was not for the advantage of the Heir, but to be conſtrued according to the meaning of <hi>Philpot,</hi> That if <hi>Hurlock</hi> could not have the Lands, &amp;c. that then the Son ſhould have them, but with ſuch charge as aforeſaid; and it was no Intent to ſubvert the firſt part of the Will, if the ſame might ſtand with the Law.

                  <p>
                     <hi>LOvelace,</hi> Serjeant, moved this Caſe to the Court, That an Aſſiſe was brought of the Office of Regiſterſhip in the County of <hi>Devon:</hi> And he ſhewed, How that the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> granted the Office, and ſhewed the name of the Biſhop: And that after <hi>William Alley</hi> Biſhop there, granted the ſame Office after the death of the firſt Grantee to the Plaintiff: And further he ſhewed, That the Biſhop might grant the Office <hi>ad Idoneam perſonam:</hi> And becauſe he doth not ſay in his Plaint, That the perſon to whom it was granted, is <hi>idonea perſona,</hi> I conceive, that the Plaint is not good; for if there be no ſuch perſon which can exerciſe the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he ſhall not have it: For that is a Condition which is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Office, that he be a fit perſon who ſhall take it: And the Prothonotaries of this place ought to have skill in that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to their Office; For if ſuch an Office ſhould be given to a Courtier who hath not skill in that which appertaineth to the Office, nor knowledge how to execute, he ſhall not have it. Alſo he ſaid, That he hath not ſhewed, that the firſt Biſhop is dead, or that he hath reſigned; or whether that he be deprived; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be intended, that he continueth, unleſs the contrary be ſhewed: And then the Grant made by <hi>Alley</hi> to the Plaintiff, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good. And for theſe cauſes, and for others, he prayed to know the Opinion of the Court. <hi>Dyer,</hi> Iuſtice, The matter is not before us; and wherefore ſhould we give our Opinions to ſerve the fancy of every perſon, and to reſolve the doubts of every Court? But if the matter laid come before by Adjournment for difficulty, becauſe the Iuſtices of Aſſiſe are of divers Opinions, or that they doubted of any thing upon ſuch difficulty and adjournment, we uſe to ſhew our Opinions, and to take ſome pains to ſearch our Books
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99485:22"/>
to Reſolve the doubts; but when we have not any thing before us; but are moved for the pleaſure of the parties, What Reſolutions ſhall we make by ſpeaking at random? <hi>Manwood,</hi> As to the firſt Exception, I, nor my Brother <hi>Jeffery,</hi> do not doubt of it, but that the Plaint was good, notwithſtanding that it is not ſhewed, that he was <hi>idonea perſona,</hi> for the Law ſhall intend him ſo to be, until the contrary he ſhewed. And ſo it is of a grant of an Annuity, as long as he <hi>ſe bene geſſerit,</hi> the Law ſhall intend that he carrieth himſelf well, until the contrary be ſhewed. But as to the other Point, That he doth not ſhew the death of the firſt Biſhop, my Brother <hi>Jeffery</hi> doubted of it, but I make no doubt of it, for that is but a Recital, and the Plaintiff makes his title but from Biſhop <hi>Alley,</hi> and therefore that is not material, nor parcel of his Plaint, whether the predeceſſor of <hi>Alley</hi> be alive, or not; for he doth not derive any Title from him, but from <hi>Alley. Dyer,</hi> Can a Biſhop grant an Office in Reverſion, without title of Preſcription, that they have uſed ſo to do time out of mind? And here no Preſcription is laid, that the Biſhop might ſo do. And then, as I conceive, the Reverſion of the Office cannot be granted, for there is not any Reverſion of it: and it is not like unto an Advowſon, which may be granted, that the Grantee may preſent when it ſhall be next void. And as I conceive, No Reverſion of any Office can be granted, if not by the King who hath a ſpecial Prerogative; For he reciting, how that ſuch an one hath ſuch an Office for life, he may grant that ſuch a perſon ſhall have the ſame Office after the death of the firſt Grantee. And ſo the Queen may grant the Reverſion of ſuch an Office; as if ſhe recite, that ſuch an one is Keeper of ſuch a Park, there ſhe may grant the Keeperſhip of it after the death of another: But if a Common perſon will grant the Stewardſhip of his Courts after the death of ſuch a perſon as is now Steward, or the Reverſion of it, the ſame is not good: For of Offices, there is not any Fee, or Reverſion, But a Nomination which the party hath to name what perſon he pleaſeth when the ſame ſhall become void. <hi>Manwood,</hi> It is the Order in the Arches, and in the Prerogative Court, and of all the Courts of <hi>Pauls,</hi> to grant the Offices in Reverſion, as in the Caſe of Doctor <hi>Drury</hi> and others, who have the Reverſion of every Office which doth belong to the Spiritual Courts. <hi>Dyer,</hi> I do not care, nor regard what they do, but what they ought to do; and I do not reſpect the perſon of any one in relating the Law; But it may be, that by words of Covenant, ſuch a Covenant may be good: And of late time here a Caſe hath been adjudged, That where one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that ſuch an one might grant an Office, <hi>cuicun<expan>

                           <am>

                        </expan> perſonis,</hi> by that, he cannot grant it but to one perſon, and not unto divers, becauſe the preſcription doth not extend ſo far. <hi>Manwood,</hi> I conceive there is a difference betwixt ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99485:23"/>
who have Offices for life, as the Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> the Lord Treaſurer, the Iuſtices of the two Benches, which have Offices incident to their Courts, they cannot grant any of thoſe Offices in Reverſion; But a Biſhop hath a Fee, and therefore the Caſes are not alike. <hi>Dyer,</hi> he hath not preſcribed in the perſon of the Biſhop here; but he hath ſaid, That the Cuſtom is, That the Biſhop may grant the ſaid Office, whereas in truth, if there were a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, he ought to preſcribe, That the Biſhop for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might grant the ſaid Office in poſſeſſion or in reverſion: And ſo as I conceive here, no Office ſhall be granted in reverſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by preſcription; which ought to be alledged. And in the time of this Queen, an Office of this Court was granted to <hi>Fry</hi> and his Son by the King; and the Patent was ſhewed here in Court, and rejected: and it was ſaid, there was no place in Court for two to ſit there, and the Office might be exerciſed as well by one, as by two; and therefore the Patent was diſallowed. And although that Offices are granted to two, as now in the Kings Bench of late time, there is not any Preſident to warrant the ſame; and therefore, as I conceive, ſuch a Grant is not good, nor warranted by the Law; for I do not regard in this Caſe, againſt what perſons I ſpeak. <hi>Mounſon,</hi> In the Chancery, a Patent was granted to <hi>Bagot</hi> and <hi>Swirenden,</hi> of an Office in the Chancery by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, and in 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. it is is diſputed, Whether the Grant were good, or not, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>THe Caſe was this; A Man had made a Leaſe for 40 years to one by Indenture, if the Leſſee ſhould ſo long live; and afterwards by another Deed he demiſed the ſame Lands and Tenements to the ſame Leſſee, To have to his Executors and Aſſigns for 40 years after the expiration of the firſt Leaſe. And <hi>Lovelace,</hi> Serjeant, demanded the Opinion of the Court, (the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> being then in the Star-Chamber) Whether in this Caſe, the Leſſee ſhould have the Intereſt in the ſecond Leaſe, or his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors; or whether it was a void Leaſe? <hi>Harper,</hi> Iuſtice, ſaid, That in every Leaſe there are 3 things incident to make it good, 1. That there be a Leſſor to make the Leaſe. 2. That there be a Leſſee to take the Leaſe. And, 3. That there be a thing which ſhould be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99485:23"/>
which ſhould be let: And then he ſaid, That here, although that there be a Leſſor, and a thing which ſhould be leaſed, yet here there was not any Leſſee: For Executors are not until after the death of the Teſtator: But he ſaid, That if a Leaſe be made for years, or for life, and that the Executors ſhall have the ſame for certain years after his death, the ſame is good; for there is an Intereſt of the Term. And if a Man maketh a Leaſe to begin at the month of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> his Executors may have this Term, becauſe the ſame was an Intereſt of a Term in the Leſſee, and the Term ſhall be executed at <hi>Eaſter:</hi> But here in this caſe, there is no perſon to take it, and therefore he conceived, That the Leaſe was void. <hi>Mounſon,</hi> Iuſtice, The Caſe is as it is recited: And he ſaid, That the Premiſſes of a Deed, is to limit the perſon who ſhall have the Leaſe, and the <hi>Habendum</hi> ſhall not declare the perſon who ſhall have it, or the Leaſe, but to declare the Eſtate which ſhall be in the Leaſe; and it is but a limitation of the Eſtate: and if the Premiſſes do not limit the perſon who ſhall have it, the <hi>Habendum</hi> ſhall not give any thing to the perſon, unleſs it be expreſſed in the Premiſſes what perſon ſhall have it: and therefore when he ſaith, <hi>Habendum to his Executors and Aſſigns,</hi> theſe words (<hi>Executors and Aſſigns</hi>) are void: But when a Man makes a Leaſe to one, <hi>Habendum</hi> to his Executors and Aſſigns, the ſame is not void; for if Livery be made, his Heir ſhall take it after his death. <hi>Harper,</hi> By the Leaſe of the ſame Land by a new Deed, as the Caſe is here, nothing ſhall paſs without an <hi>Habendum:</hi> And if a Leaſe be made to the Leſſee, <hi>Habendum</hi> to his Executors, he himſelf hath no Eſtate; and when no Eſtate is limited, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Premiſſes gains not any thing, and without the <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> he cannot have any thing. <hi>Lovelace,</hi> If I may declare my Opinion, This new Leaſe ſhall be a Leaſe in poſſeſſion as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the firſt Leaſe, and ſhall be taken to be a Leaſe for life, and the <hi>Habendum</hi> ſhall be void; and therefore he prayed the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Manwood,</hi> Iuſtice, therein: Who ſaid, That in every Leaſe there are 3 Principals, as he had ſaid, of Leſſor, Leſſee, and thing Let: And by the Premiſſes, the Leſſor and Leſſee are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and by the <hi>Habendum,</hi> the Intereſt which the Leſſee ſhall have, ought to be ſet forth; and if no <hi>Habendum</hi> be in the Deed to expreſs any certainty of time, the Leſſee by the ſame ſhall be Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of your Opinion, Brother <hi>Lovelace,</hi> That the ſame ſhall be a Leaſe for life, unleſs that in the ſecond Deed the words had been, <hi>That he Leaſed and Granted;</hi> by which word, <hi>Grant,</hi> it might enure and amount to a Leaſe for life: but if the Deed had been, <hi>Demiſe and Grant,</hi> that cannot be intended for the life of the Leſſee; And as I have ſaid before, by apt words it might enure to a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and make it a Leaſe for life; but by the Premiſſes it is not ſo, and by this Deed it is not expreſſed, that the Leſſee ſhall take a Freehold; for by the <hi>Habendum,</hi> his mind appeareth to be otherwiſe by agreement betwixt the parties, that his Executors and Aſſigns

ſhould have it for a certain time after his death, and that he himſelf would not have it, for he hath ſufficiently provided for himſelf, to have if for 40 years, if he liveth ſo long, although it cannot be intended, that he ſhould live beyond the Term which he hath, ſo as it cannot be taken to be the meaning of the parties, that he ſhould have it as a Leaſe for life: and when by the Premiſſes of the Deed, the parties are not named, the <hi>Habendum</hi> ſhall never bring in a ſtrange perſon: As, where a Leaſe is made to the Husband, <hi>Habendum</hi> to the Wife, the <hi>Habendum</hi> to her is a void, becauſe it ſhall not introduce one who is a ſtranger to the Premiſſes of the Deed. And as my Brother <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hath ſaid, The Office of the Premiſſes of a Deed is to limit the perſons who ſhall have it, and the Office of the <hi>Habendum</hi> is to limit the Eſtate of the thing which is granted; and therefore when the <hi>Habendum</hi> is to ſuch a perſon as was not named in the Premiſſes of the Deed, it is but a Nugation: As if he had Leaſed to <hi>J.S. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum</hi> to the <hi>Moon</hi> for certain years, there the <hi>Habendum</hi> to that thing is a Nugation, and void; and therefore then if the words be in the Premiſſes, that he Leaſeth to <hi>J.S.</hi> for 20 years, and doth not ſay, that he ſhall have it for 20 years, it ſhall be intended, that the perſon named in the Premiſſes ſhall have it, for the <hi>Habendum</hi> waits upon the Grant before; and when he gives an Eſtate in the <hi>Habendum</hi> without limiting of the perſon in it, then the perſon named in the Premiſſes ſhall have it; and then when he names a ſtrange perſon who was not named before in the Premiſſes, or which hath no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as the <hi>Moon,</hi> or ſuch like who are not in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> as his Executors of the Leſſee, or his Aſſigns, theſe perſons or things named in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> are but Nugations, and void; and then it is like unto the Caſe where no perſon is limited in the <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi> And where apt words are, there the Law ſhall conſtrue them ſtrong againſt the Grantor; and therefore the Law couples the <hi>Habendum</hi> and the Premiſſes together, that the intent of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may (if by any means it may) have a reaſonable Conſtruction. And therefore if a Man maketh a Leaſe to two, <hi>Habendum</hi> to one of them and a third perſon, there as to the third perſon he gets nothing by the <hi>Habendum,</hi> becauſe he was not named in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, and therefore the naming him in the <hi>Habendum</hi> is but a Nugation. And ſo here, the naming of the Executors and Aſſigns by the <hi>Habendum,</hi> is but a Nugation, and ſo there is no perſon named in it. But I conceive, that the <hi>Habendum,</hi> when the years are expreſſed, and the Eſtate limited by it, ſhall have reference to the perſon who is named in the Premiſſes of the Deed, and ſo the Leaſe ſhall be good to him to begin after the firſt Term expired. <hi>Harper,</hi> It appeareth that it was the meaning of the parties, that he himſelf would not have any thing, but that his Will was, That his Executors ſhould have it, and the Law ſhall frame his intent and meaning, and ſhall not ſubject the Law to his intent; and when he doth not ſo, but overthwarts the Law and frames ſuch an Inſtrument, the Law ſhall be firſt ſerved, and not their meanings,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99485:24"/>
when the ſame doth not agree with the Law. And therefore as to the Caſe which my Brother <hi>Manwood</hi> hath put, Where no perſon is named in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> by Conſtruction of Law, he who is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Premiſſes ſhall have it: But when the <hi>Habendum</hi> makes expreſs mention of his intent what perſon ſhall have it, and another than was named in the Premiſſes, then if thoſe cannot have it, the Eſtate limited ſhall not be carried over to him who was named in the Premiſſes. And as to the Caſe put, where a Leaſe is made to two, <hi>Habendum</hi> to one of them, and a third perſon, there I well agree, That as to the third perſon it is but a Nugation; and the other two who are named with him in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> and have a Capacity to take it, ſhall have it, although the other getteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but that is not like to the Caſe at Bar, for no perſon is named there. <hi>Manwood,</hi> If a Leaſe be made made to <hi>J.S.</hi> except <hi>Green-Cloſe,</hi> to <hi>J.D.</hi> who is a ſtranger, the Exception is good, and <hi>J.D.</hi> ſhall have it.

                  <p>UPon an Evidence given to a Iury in the Kings Bench, in an <hi>Ejectione Firmae,</hi> the Caſe appeared to be thus; That Sir <hi>Roger Lewknor,</hi> Knight, being ſeiſed in Fee of the Mannor of <hi>South Myms,</hi> made an Indenture, <hi>Anno</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he Leaſed the ſaid Mannor to 20 perſons, to the uſe of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Windſor,</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, and the Survivor of them, as long as any of the ſaid perſons named in the ſaid Indenture ſhould live: And further Covenanted by the ſame Indenture, To ſtand ſeiſed of the ſaid Mannor, To the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Survivor of them, during the lives of any of the ſaid Feoffees named in the ſame Indenture; which Deed was made without Livery and Seiſin; and reſerved upon it an yearly Rent: and afterwards the Son died. And in 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A Fine was levied by a ſtranger upon a Releaſe to <hi>Andrew</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor;</hi> And afterwards, 34 of <hi>Henry</hi> 8 <hi>Andrew</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor</hi> made a Leaſe to one for years, and died; and made <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Edmond</hi> his Sons his Executors: And afterwards <hi>William</hi> his eldeſt Son being Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mary,</hi> made a Leaſe of the ſame Land unto another, to begin after the firſt Leaſe ended: Which <hi>William</hi> died, and the Lord <hi>Windſor</hi> that now is, accepted the Rent, and of late time agreed with one <hi>Vaughan,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Heir of Sir <hi>Roger Lewknor,</hi> for the Reverſion in Fee; and afterwards the Leaſe made by <hi>Andrew</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ended in the 4th year of the Reign of the Queen that now is; Whereupon, the ſecond Leſſee, that is to ſay, the Leſſee of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> entred; and being ouſted, he brought the <hi>Ejectione firmae.</hi> And then, and yet one of the 20 Feoffees of Sir <hi>Roger Lewknor</hi> is alive; ſo as the Eſtate of <hi>Ceſtuy que Vie,</hi> is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99485:25"/>
not as yet determined. And now the Queſtion upon the firſt part of the Evidence is, If this later Leaſe made by <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> be a good Leaſe or not? And who ſhall be ſaid Occupant? For when the Lord <hi>Andrew</hi> died, then the Leſſee (as <hi>Catline</hi> ſaid) ſhall not be ſaid in otherwiſe than according to his Leaſe, when his occupation by Leaſe was lawful before: And he who ſhall be ſaid Occupant, ſhall have a Freehold; and if he ſhould be Occupant, he ſhould be in by a new title. Then we are to ſee, If the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Lord which have the Rent, and to whom the ſame is paid by the Leſſee, ſhall be ſaid Occupant? And he conceived, That they ſhould not, although that they enter, unleſs they claim the Freehold at the time of their entry; for if they enter general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſhall be intended according to the Will, as Executors; and if he had granted his Eſtate to another, there after his death, the Grantee ſhall be ſaid to be in by reaſon of his Grant, and not as Occupant; And ſo if he would deviſe his Eſtate, the Deviſee ſhall be in by reaſon of the Deviſe, and not as Occupant; Which Caſe of Deviſe, <hi>Southcote</hi> denyed, That he ſhould not be in by reaſon of the Deviſe, when his Eſtate determines with his death: But if the Deviſee entreth by force of the Deviſe: he ſhall be in as an Occupant. And alſo <hi>Southcote</hi> denyed that which had been ſaid, That the Leſſee for years who holdeth the Lands after the death of <hi>Andrew</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſhould not be an Occupant: For, as he ſaid, the Leſſee being in poſſeſſion after the death of the Lord <hi>Andrew,</hi> ſhould be ſaid Occupant, and no other; for the Executors of the Lord could not be Occupant by the having of the Rent, becauſe they had not the poſſeſſion of the Land; for none ſhall be Occupant, but he who is in poſſeſſion. <hi>Whiddon</hi> ſaid, That if the firſt Leaſe made by <hi>Andrew</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> was now <hi>in eſſe,</hi> and that an <hi>Ejectione Firmae</hi> was brought upon that, that the Leſſee ought to aver, That ſome of the Feoffees for whoſe lives, &amp;c. were then living. <hi>Southcote,</hi> If a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> ſhall be brought, againſt whom ſhall it be brought, againſt him in the Reverſion, or againſt him in poſſeſſion? And if it ſhall be brought againſt the Tenant in poſſeſſion, then he ought to have the Freehold; for it cannot be brought, but againſt one who hath a Freehold at the leaſt: And then if the Lord <hi>William Windſor</hi> had nothing in the Land, then how could he make this Leaſe to the Plaintiff that now is, when the firſt Leſſee continueth Occupant after the death of the Lord <hi>Andrew,</hi> during the life of <hi>Ceſtuy que Vye?</hi> And as to the Fine, the Queſtion did further ariſe, If the Lord <hi>Andrew Windſor</hi> ſhould have a Feeſimple by that Fine? For being levied, (as <hi>Catline</hi> ſaid) It cannot be to the firſt Vſes, becauſe a Fine upon a Releaſe, cannot be intended to the uſe of any other but to him to whom it is levied, unleſs an uſe be expreſſed in the Fine, or by another Deed: And upon a Fine levied upon a Releaſe made unto Tenant life by a ſtranger, the ſame is not a forfeiture of his Eſtate; But if Tenant for life taketh a Fine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99485:25"/>
                     <hi>Sur Conuſans de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> the ſame is a forfeiture. And although a Fine levied by thoſe who have not any thing in the Lands, be void, Yet here it is not ſo; and it ought to be pleaded ſpecially, and ſhewed, that he had not anything in the Land at the time the Fine was levied, as <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid. And <hi>Catline</hi> ſaid, That this Fine was not without good advice, for the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> and others who were learned in the Law, were of Counſel with the Lord <hi>Windſor</hi> in the levying of this Fine, ſo as the intent was to ſettle the Feeſimple in himſelf by the Fine, and not that the firſt Vſes ſhould ſtand after that: And thereupon he put the Caſe of <hi>Putnam</hi> and <hi>Duncomb,</hi> which hath much Reſemblance to this Caſe, which he argued when he was Serjeant, and held the ſame Opinion as he holdeth now; And therefore he ſaid, That although the Purchaſe was but of late time of <hi>Vaughan</hi> and his Wife, yet the Fee was in the Lord <hi>Windſor</hi> before, and this manner of purchaſe was to no other end, but to diſcharge the Lands of Incumbrances, as appeareth by the ſmall ſum which was paid, the Land being of a great yearly value. And, as <hi>Vaughan</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he took this ſum of Mony, becauſe that his Council informed him, that the Feeſimple was in the Lord <hi>Windſor</hi> before, and that otherwiſe he would not have ſold it at ſuch a price. And he ſaid, That before that agreement, the Lord <hi>Windſor</hi> told him, that he had the Feeſimple in himſelf. Whereupon <hi>Vaughan</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, Wherefore he paid the Rent? To whom the Lord <hi>Windſor</hi> anſwered, That he paid the ſame during the lives of the Feoffees, but after their deaths, he paid nothing; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that payment, that the Feeſimple remained in him, and that his Counſel adviſed him to pay the Rent to the Heirs of <hi>Lewknor,</hi> who was the Wife of the ſaid <hi>Vaughan.</hi> And <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> ſaid, That if a Fine be levied upon a Releaſe, in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Conuſor, he ſhall not plead, that the Conuſor had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in the Land at time of the Fine levied. And he ſaid further, That if a Diſſeiſor be, and the Diſſeiſee levieth a Fine upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, that thereby his Right is gone.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Note;</hi> That as to the principal Caſe, <hi>Southcote</hi> was of Opinion, That the Fee was not gained by the Fine levied by a ſtranger to him who had the Vſe before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and that if no Feeſimple was in the Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> at the time of the Leaſe made by him, that the Leaſe could not be good, nor the Action maintainable. And becauſe the Court was divided in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in both Points, <hi>Catline</hi> commanded the Iury to find a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Verdict.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>NOte:</hi> That it was ſaid by the whole Court, That if a Man delivereth Mony to another Man to buy Cattel, or to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe with, although that the Mony be ſealed up in a Bag, yet the property of the Mony is to the Bailee, and the Bailor cannot have an Action for the Mony, but only an Accompt againſt the Bailee, although that he never buyeth the Cattel or other things, for the Auditors upon the Accompt ſhall allow him the ſum and ſuch other allowances as they ſhall think fit. And that a ſtranger takes away the Mony, after the death of the Bailee, or in his life-time, the Bailor ſhall not have an Action againſt the ſtranger, but the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Bailee, or the Bailee himſelf during his life; And yet if the Bailee dieth, no Action of Accompt lieth againſt his Executors, becauſe the Teſtator had the property of the Monies. And therefore if he, who takes the Mony from the Bailee, promiſeth the Bailor, to pay him the like ſum of Mony as the Bailee had received of him in his life, and as ſhould be truly proved by the Bailor; there, upon that Promiſe, an Action upon the Caſe doth not lie againſt him who took away the Mony, as <hi>Catline</hi> ſaid, In an Action upon the Caſe brought by the Maſter of the Rolls, and another, who ſuppoſed, that they delivered 100 <hi>l.</hi> to one <hi>Moore,</hi> and that he is dead, and that the Mony came unto the hands of the Defendant, and that thereupon he promiſed to pay the like ſum which might be proved that <hi>Moore</hi> had of the Plaintiffs. It was holden, That the Action upon the Caſe did not lie. <hi>Southcote,</hi> Iuſtice, ſaid, That although the property of the Mony be changed as before, and that no Accompt lieth againſt a ſtranger; Yet when he hath the Mony, and for that cauſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to pay it as before, it is reaſon, that an Action upon the Caſe ſhould lie upon his promiſe, although the Law will not charge him nor the Executors upon an Accompt.</p>

And further ſaith, That in <hi>Anno</hi> 6 <hi>of Ed. the</hi> 6th, the Homage then (whereof <hi>Franklin</hi> the Plaintiff was one) made By-Law, That none ſhould put his Sheep to feed in the Paſture or Lands of the Lord upon a pain, &amp;c. And that the ſaid <hi>Franklin,</hi> in the 13th year of the Reign of the Lady
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99485:26"/>
the Queen that now is, had put his Sheep into the Paſture and Lands of the Lord to feed; and for that they avow the taking in the right of the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> for not payment of the ſaid For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture: And <hi>Jefferies</hi> of Council with the Plaintiff, ſaid, That the Avowry, nor the Conuſans were not good; For the Cuſtom is, as they themſelves have ſhewed, That the By-Law ſhall be made when neceſſity requireth (and without neceſſity a By-Law cannot be:) And it is not alledged here, That there was a neceſſity at the time of this By-Law made; and then if there be no neceſſity, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make the By-Law. Alſo, it is not alledged, that there were any Sheep there; And when a Cuſtom is pleaded, it ſhall be pleaded <hi>stricti juris.</hi> And at the Common Law, you may ſee divers Caſes, That when a Man is to have one thing for the cauſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he muſt alledge the thing for which he muſt have it: As in 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Where an Abbot had granted to one, That he ſhould have Common, whereſoever the Cattel of the Abbot ſhould go; there if the Commoner will juſtifie or make Avowry for his Common, he muſt aver that the Beaſts of the Abbot went then in ſuch a place, Field, or Paſture; for if they did not go there at the time that he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth or avoweth, his Iuſtification or Avowry ſhall not be good: And there it was ſaid by <hi>Babbington,</hi> Chief Iuſtice, That if a Man grants Common whenſoever his Cattel ſhall go in ſuch a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, If the Grantor doth never put his Cattel into the Paſture, the Grantee ſhall not have Common there: and therefore he muſt ſay, That he put his Beaſts into the Paſture. And in 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in the Caſe of an Annuity granted until he be promoted to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, in a Writ of Annuity brought, he muſt ſay, That he is not promoted, &amp;c. And if an Obligation be made to you, to you my Lord, for Mony, when <hi>J.S.</hi> ſhall return from <hi>Rome;</hi> you ſhall not have an Action upon the Bond for not payment of the Mony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alledging, that <hi>J.S.</hi> is retorned. <hi>See</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Hillary<hi>'s Caſe;</hi>
                     </hi> And before the Statute of <hi>Quia Emptores terrarum,</hi> If a Man had made a Feoffment to hold by Fealty, and the Guarding of his Caſtle, In an Avowry for the Caſtle Guard, that there was then War, and ſo cauſe of neceſſity; for in time of Peace he ſhall not be bound to Guard it. And ſo it appeareth, 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Where a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made before the Statute, to hold by Fealty, and every year to marry a poor Maiden within the Mannor, if he doth avow for not marriage, he ought to alledge, that there was a poor Maid that year within the Mannor. So, if the Tenure be to repair a Bridge that is for the Common wealth, and he and all others are to have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, yet the Lord ſhall not avow for not repairing of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alledging, that the Bridge was in decay. And ſo when the Tenure is to Cover his Hall, he ſhall not Avow, without alledging, that his Hall needed Reparations. And ſo in the principal Caſe, here he ought to alledge, that there was a preſent neceſſity for making of the By-Law; for it may be, that there was not any Sheep within the Mannor when the By-Law was made, and then there was no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99485:27"/>
cauſe that it ſhould be made. And in the like manner as it hath been ſaid of the Common Law, That certainty ought to be ſhewed, ſo ſhall it be by the Statute Laws. As if Tenant for life makes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, if one prayeth to be received for the default of the Tenant for life, he ought to ſhew that he hath the Reverſion, and that he bringeth his Action by reaſon thereof: And as it hath been ſaid of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and Statute Law, ſo it ſhall be ſaid of Cuſtom; As in 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3 where the Pariſhioners preſcribe to make By-Laws, and that they made ſuch an Ordinance, That for every Acre of Land, or for every Beaſt, every one ſhould pay for the Reparations of the Church, &amp;c. there it may be ſaid in Avowry, that the Church wanted Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſo where a Tax and Levy is to make a Wall againſt the See; there if the party will juſtifie the levying of the Tax or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, he muſt ſay, That there was need of it, otherwiſe the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be levied: But as to the ability of a perſon, he ſhall be enabled by Intendment. As if an Obligation be made by a Man or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in an Action brought upon the Bond, he ſhall not be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſay, That the Man was of full age, or that the Woman was a ſingle Woman, for that ſhall be intended, until the contrary be ſhewed: But by Statute Law, if a Man pleads a Grant, it ſhall be otherwiſe. As upon the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. If he plead a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a Grant of <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe,</hi> he muſt plead, That he was of full age, out of priſon, of ſound memory, and within the 4 Seas. And ſo where a Pardon was made in the time of King <hi>Ed. the</hi> 14th, to all, but to thoſe who were with Queen <hi>Margaret;</hi> there, if he will take advantage of the Pardon, he muſt plead, That he was not with the ſaid Queen. And if a Man plead a Feoffment of <hi>J.S.</hi> at the Common Law, it ſhall be good; and if he were within age, it ſhall be ſhewed on the other ſide: But if a Man pleadeth a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Cuſtom; and the other ſaith, that the Feoffor was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, age, and the Plaintiff replyeth, That an Enfant by the Cuſtom may make a Feoffment; the ſame is not good, but a Departure: for he ought to have ſhewed that at the beginning in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Where a Man pleaded a Deviſe, and it was ſhewed, that the Deviſor was within age; there the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff need not ſay, that the Cuſtom is, That an Enfant may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe; for that is a Departure. Another matter of the Cuſtom which they have alledged, is, That they may make By-Laws for the better Ordering; and they have not taken averment, that this Ordinance was either better or worſe: and if it be not better, then they have no cauſe to make the By-Law. If a Feoffment be made <hi>cauſa Matrimonii praeloquuti,</hi> it ſhall not be intended, that the Feoffment was for any other cauſe than Marriage: And if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brings a Writ of Dower, and the Defendant pleads a Leaſe for life made by the Husband, it ſhall not be intended that that Leaſe was in allowance of her Dower according to the Statute, if it be not expreſly ſhewed. And ſo, If <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> in tail makes a Leaſe for life, it ſhall not be intended that <hi>Ceſtuy que Vie</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99485:27"/>
is alive, unleſs a ſpecial Averment be taken, That he is yet alive: And ſo here it doth not appear; that this is the better Order, nor that the Lands are ſeveral, or lie in Common, ſo as by no means or Circumſtance it can appear if it be the better or not. Another cauſe wherefore the pleading is not ſufficient, is, Becauſe he ſaith, Vpon a pain of Forfeiture to the Lord for the time being; and he hath not alledged in fact, that the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was Lord of the Mannor in <hi>Anno</hi> 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. was Lord in the 13th year of the Reign of the Queen that now is; and, without ſhewing, that ſhall not be intended. As in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. A Man pleads a Feoffment, and that <hi>J.S.</hi> was ſeiſed, and did enfeoffe him, that is not good; but he ought to plead, that he being ſo ſeiſed, made the Feoffment; for it ſhall not be intended, that his ſeiſin continued until the time of the Feoffment, without ſhewing of it. And ſo where a Man pleads, That <hi>J.S.</hi> was ſeiſed of a Reverſion, granted it; he ought to plead, And that he being ſo ſeiſed, granted it: And ſo where an Attornment is pleaded; for if he was not ſeiſed at the time of the Attornment, the Attornment was not good. And ſo where a Man will plead a Surrender, he ſhall ſhew, that he who Surrendreth, and he to whom a Surrender is made, were ſeiſed. <hi>Quaere,</hi> If the one or the other were not ſeiſed, one of the Term, and the other of the Reverſion, whether the Surrender be not good. And 31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. If a Man will plead a Leaſe by Feoffees to uſe, he ſhall ſay, And that ſo ſeiſed, they made the Leaſe. And <hi>ſee</hi> 6, 7, 10, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Where <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> makes a Feoffment, averment ſhall be taken, that at the time of the Leaſe that the Feoffees were ſeiſed to the uſe of the Leſſor. And becauſe that here it is not ſhewed, nor alledged, that the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> is now Lord of the Mannor, it ſhall not be ſo intended: Alſo, for divers other cauſes, I conceive, that the Avowry is inſufficient: For he hath ſhewed, that a By-Law was made, but doth not ſhew when it was made, nor for what time it was to continue; And it is not ſhewed, Whether the ſame were made for the better ordering of the Lands which the Lord held joyntly, or in common with others, or which he held in his own Right alone: And as to the Preſcription, I conceive that the ſame is not good; becauſe it is againſt reaſon, and not <hi>ex rationabili cauſa:</hi> For if one Man keeps the Law, and another Man breaks the Law, yet according as they have alledged this Cuſtom to be, he may be diſtrained who hath not offended, and his Cattel taken for the Offence done by the Cattel of another Man; and it is againſt reaſon, that any one ſhould be puniſhed for the default or offence of another: But the Cuſtom of Borough Engliſh is good; and ſo is the Cuſtom of Gavelkind, becauſe that every Son is as good a Gentleman as the eldeſt; and therefore thoſe Cuſtoms ſtand with Reaſon. And ſo in 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Where a Man preſcribes, That for the Paſture which the Beaſts of the Tenant have taken in his Lands in the day-time; that he have the Foldage of them upon his ſaid Lands in the Night to manure his Lands, is a good preſcription,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99485:28"/>
becauſe the party hath for it <hi>Quid pro Quo.</hi> And ſo where a Man preſcribes to have a Farthing of every one who paſſeth over his Land, the ſame is called Toll traverſe, and is good. And ſo in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. Where a Man preſcribes in Common by reaſon of Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, it is good; for though it cannot be of Common Right, yet becauſe each hath <hi>Quid pro Quo,</hi> it is good. And ſo is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom for Fiſhermen to dry their Nets upon the Banks of the Lands of other Men lying upon the Sea Coaſts, becauſe it is for the Common wealth; and every Man hath an advantage by it, but if a Man ſhould preſcribe to Fowle there upon the Lands of another, that were not good. <hi>Meade,</hi> contrary, That caſe is, as it hath been put; and divers Caſes of the Common Law, Cuſtom, and Statute Laws, have been ſhewed: And by common Intendment, it is intended, that need doth require the making of the By-Law; for otherwiſe, they would not have made it; and there needs not any averment, that there was need of it, for that ſhall be taken by intendment: As 19 <hi>E.</hi> 4. A Man counts of the Grant of the next Avoydance, and the Count is good, without ſhewing, that that was the next Avoydance, but yet it would have been better, if it had been expreſſed. And 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. In Treſpaſs, the firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> the Defendant pleads the Licence of the Plaintiff; without ſhewing, that it was for the ſame Treſpaſs: and yet it ſhall be intended, when he pleads a Licence for the ſame day, that it was for the ſame Treſpaſs. And as to the Caſe put upon the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. it hath been ruled otherwiſe; for it ſhall be ſhewed on the other ſide, that he was within age, as it appeareth by 10 <hi>&amp;</hi> 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Alſo he ſaid, that the Court here ſhall intend, that there was a neceſſity ſufficient, without expreſſing of it; and if there was not, then it ought to be alledged on the other ſide: As 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. An Annuity is granted until he was advanced to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, the Plaintiff ſhall not need to ſhew it, but that ſhall come on the Defendants part; And the Statute which is, That no Cattel of the Plough ſhall be diſtrained where the party hath other Cattel of which a Diſtreſs may be taken, there the party needs not to alledge, that he had other Cattel, or other Goods. And as to that which hath been ſaid, That it was the better Order, that needs not, for the Defendant himſelf was one of the makers of the Order; and when By-Laws are made, they ſhall not extend but to the Tenants within the Mannor where they are made, and to ſuch only as have Lands there, and not to the Lands of others which are out of the Mannor: and the Defendant in this caſe ſhall not be received to ſay, but that this is a good Cuſtom and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe he is a party to it, and was the maker of it, and that there was then a neceſſity for the making of it, for the better order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lands; and that eſpecially when as the Defendant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was a party to it: And as to that which is ſaid, That Seiſin is alledged in the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> in 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. and it is not alledged, that the Seiſin did continue in him until 13th of this Queen; It
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99485:28"/>
ſhall be intended, that he continued ſeiſed until the contrary be ſhewed. As in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. A Man preſcribed to have Common by reaſon of the Houſe, &amp;c. The Avowant doth not ſay, that he was ſeiſed of the Houſe at the time, &amp;c. of the diſſeiſin of the Common, becauſe he once alledged Seiſin of the Houſe, and that Seiſin ſhall be intended to continue unto the time of the diſſeiſin. And ſo 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. A Prior <hi>Domus &amp; Eccleſiae de C.</hi> brought Waſte, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that it was to the diſenhereſin of the Houſe, and did not ſay, <hi>praedict. Domus;</hi> and yet it was good, and ſhall be referred to the ſaid Priory: And ſo here, when he ſaith, that he was Lord, and that the By-Law was made as before, and a penalty impoſed, and a Diſtreſs taken by the Bailiff of the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the By-Law, and payment of the ſum aſſeſſed, all being put together, makes a ſufficient certainty, and that the Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> continued his Seiſin of the Mannor and Land: And as to that which hath been ſaid, That the By-Law made, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom alledged to diſtrain in the Lands of any Man for the Offence of another, is not reaſonable; and againſt the Law: To that he ſaid, That the Tenants here had authority to make By-Laws, and by their conſents have bounden themſelves to the obſerving and performance of them, and therefore ſhall not now be received to ſay, That the By-Law made by themſelves was againſt the Law. And he ſaid, That the Cuſtoms in ſome places are, Where there are Waſte Lands, that they may make By-Laws, That if any Tenant or perſon dig Turfs in the ſame Waſte, that the Lord may diſtrain for ſuch offence within any place of the Mannor, and the Cattel of any perſon. <hi>Quaere</hi> of it.

As, if the Covenant and

Promiſe be, That he ſhall leave the Houſes in as good plight as he found them: there, although the Law doth not bind the party to re-edifie the Houſes in caſe they be overthrown by tempeſt of Wind; or that they be deſtroyed by Enemies; yet by his ſpecial Covenant he ſhall be bound to re-edifie them. <hi>Meade,</hi> contrary, And that this promiſe ſhall not be taken ſtrictly againſt the Leſſor,<note place="margin">Hob.

Conditions.</note> there, although there was a Penſion granted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out to another, it was holden, That the Obligee was not boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to diſcharge it of that Penſion; No more than if a Man be bounden to make a Feoffment of his Land, there, although that he charge the Land, yet he ſhall not forfeit his Bond: But if it were, that he ſhould make a Feoffment of his Land diſcharged, &amp;c. it is otherwiſe; but yet he ſhall not be bounden to diſcharge it of ſuch things with which it is charged by the Law. <hi>Barham,</hi> The words are preciſely, That he ſhall enjoy it without interruption of any perſon, ſo as be he interrupted by one that hath Title, or no Title, the Plaintiff hath cauſe of Action. <hi>Manwood,</hi> What if the words were, That he ſhould enjoy it without Suit in Law? <hi>Meade,</hi> That ſhall be intended of a lawful Suit: And in the principal caſe, although the Contract be by words, yet it is upon a good Conſideration; that is to ſay, Of a Fine and Income, and upon the payment of the Rent: And therefore as <hi>Dyer</hi> ſaid, When <hi>Catesby</hi> the Son leaſed the Lands to <hi>Mountford,</hi> the now Plaintiff, and it appeared that his Father, or a ſtranger, made claim to it, and thereupon he made the promiſe as before, ſhall it be intended, that he ſhould hold and enjoy the Lands peaceably without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of them only who had Title? And that he ſhould not have his Remedy againſt the Defendant upon his promiſe, if a ſtranger who had not Title did interrupt him? Truly, he ſhall have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt him: As if the Son had promiſed that he ſhould enjoy it againſt his Father; or elſe that in truth if it were the Land of the Father, ſhall it not be intended, that the Son did preſume that his Father ſhould not interrupt his Leſſee? And that he would ſo deal with his Father, that he ſhould not interrupt him: and it may be, that upon the preſumption of the good will of his Father, or that he had treated with him, or compounded with him; that for theſe, or the like cauſes, the Son made the promiſe aforeſaid: And if the Father had not any Right or Title to the Land, ſhould not the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee have his Action againſt the Defendant, if the Father did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

him, for this unlawful Interruption? Truly, Yes; For by the words it is to be ſuppoſed, That the Son would ſo deal with his Father, that the Leſſee ſhould enjoy and hold the Lands without any manner of interruption. <hi>Mounſon,</hi> You have well taſted the Opinion of the Court upon this matter before, and now you hear our Opinions again. <hi>Manwood,</hi> As I ſaid the other day, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not an Hoſtler take upon him, that the Goods of his Gueſts which are within his Inn, ſhall be ſafe, and charge himſelf further therewith, than he is chargeable by the Cuſtom of the Realm, and to be chargeable againſt every one that taketh them away?

                  <p>IN a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> brought by the Patron againſt the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Incumbent,<note place="margin">Dyer 327.</note> who was in by the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Archbiſhop, after the death of the Incumbent of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. It was ſaid by the Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> That of an Avoydance by Reſignation, or Deprivation, the Patron ſhall have 6 months time, after notice thereof given unto him, to preſent his Clerk, becauſe it may be done ſecretly, in the Chamber of the Ordinary; and therefore in ſuch caſe the Law is, That the Biſhop is to give notice of it to the Patron, before he be bound to that knowledge of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99485:30"/>
ſuch a Preſentment; as it appeareth by the Caſe in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. And <hi>Lowe,</hi> the Prothonotary ſaid, That ſo is the Roll of the ſame year, where the Iſſue was, Whether the Patron had 6 months after the notice? And then the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> ſaid to the Prothono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Shew me the Roll at another day, that I may compare it with my Book. But if the Church become void by death of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, there the Patron is to take notice of it at his peril, without any other notice thereof to be given him by the Ordinary: And he ſaid, That if the Patron doth preſent his Clerk a Week before the 6 months be ended, and the Ordinary doth refuſe the Clerk for Inability, becauſe he is unlearned, and then the ſix months paſs before he preſenteth another, after the ſix months after the death of the Incumbent; in ſuch caſe, the Biſhop ſhall have the Collation of the Clerk, becauſe it was the folly of the Patron, that he did not preſent his Clerk before, ſo as the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary might examine him; and that thereupon if he be found to be unable, that he might preſent another Clerk to the Ordinary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in convenient time, and for that cauſe is the 6 months given to the Patron, that he provide another Clerk in the mean time. And there is a good Caſe in 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which was long debated. Where the Ordinary commanded the Clerk to come to him afterwards to be examined, becauſe the Ordinary had then other buſineſs. And there the better Opinion of the Book is, That it was a good Plea for the Ordinary, That he did not refuſe the Clerk, but that the Clerk did not return to him again, and that the 6 months paſſed, ſo as he made the Collation, and that the Patron made his preſentation too late, ſo as he had not convenient time to examine him. Then in the Caſe at Bar, It was moved, That when the Ability and Diſability of the Clerk came in Queſtion, by whom the ſame ſhould be tryed; becauſe in the Caſe here, the Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> was a party to the Suit, Whether by the Metropolitan of <hi>York,</hi> or by the Metropolitan of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And he ſaid, That as he conceived, the Tryal of the Ability ſhould be by the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan of <hi>York,</hi> and not of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> But he ſaid, That if the party in whom the diſability was alledged was dead, ſo as he could not be examined, the Tryal of his Ability or Diſability ſhould be by the Country, as it appeareth in the Book of 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Iuſtice, The Cure of Souls is to be regarded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if an Enfant be to make a Preſentation, the ſame ſhall not be ſtayed for his Nonage; and therefore if in ſuch caſe he doth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, and ſhall not preſent his Clerk, the Law which regardeth more the Cure of Souls than the Enfancy, will permit that the Ordinary ſhall collate to the Church, if a Preſentment thereto be not made within the ſix months. And he ſaid, That if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron ſhould preſent one but a week before the end of the ſix months, and the Ordinary ſhould refuſe him for diſability: If the Patron ſhould have other ſix months then next after, he might then likewiſe preſent an Enfant or other diſabled perſon to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99485:30"/>
and ſo detract the time by fraud, and ſo the Lapſe by ſuch great fraud ſhould never devolve to the Ordinary, and ſo the Cure ſhould be unſerved; And ſo the Iſſue would be and ariſe upon the conveniency of the time. And as to that which hath been ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Ability and Diſability of the Clerk, I conceive the ſame ſhall be tryed by the Metropolitan of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and not by the Metropolitan of <hi>York. Mounſon,</hi> to that intent; and he ſaid, There is a good caſe in 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 21. which is a ſhort caſe, and not the Caſe which hath been vouched; by which it appeareth, that the preſentment that ſhall be within 6 months, ſhall be accompted from the time of the Avoydance, and not from the time of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, by the whole Court: And there it is ſaid, That the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſhall give notice to the Patron, if he be a Lay-man, of the Diſability of the Clerk, but not if he be a Spiritual perſon: But if the party Preſentee be Criminous, of that the Patron ſhall take as well notice as the Ordinary. And afterwards, the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> cauſed the Record to be read, and it did not appear therein, at what day the Preſentment was made to the Ordinary; which ought to have been ſhewed: for the great point of the Caſe doth reſt here upon the time of the Preſentment, if it were before a week that the ſix months were ended or not. Alſo the Ordinary ſaith in his Bar, That the Clerk was inſufficient, and that he gave notice to the Plaintiff, and that <hi>Nullam idoneam perſonam praeſentavit:</hi> And the Court ſaid, That that was no good manner of pleading; but it had been better, if it had been <hi>Nullam etiam perſonam idoneam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentavit,</hi> and the firſt form would be a <hi>Jeoſail. Manwood</hi> ſaid That the time of the notice given to the Patron, ought to be alledged, becauſe if the Patron ſends his Clerk within a month after the Avoydance, and the Ordinary will not give notice to the Patron in the mean time; the ſame ſhall not be any default in the Patron: And as to the notice given to the Patron, he ſaid the ſame was well pleaded, and it ſhall be intended that it was given to the perſon of the Patron. And as to the words in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ſcil. tunc vacantem,</hi> they are but void words, becauſe nothing is ſpoken before of any time. And the Incumbent pleaded the ſame Plea, as the Ordinary pleaded. And <hi>Dyer</hi> asked, If the Incumbent were <hi>Perſon imperſonee,</hi> for that none ſhould plead that Plea, but he who is Parſon in fact, and Incumbent.</p>

                  <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> the Caſe was thus: King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th was ſeiſed of certain Lands, and by his Letter Patents granted the ſame to <hi>Thomas Holt</hi> for life, the remainder to <hi>John Holt</hi> his Son, who in truth was a Baſtard; and the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia, &amp; mero motu, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe the Plaintiff did ſuppoſe, that the ſame was not a good Purchaſe, he tooke a Leaſe from the Queen, of the Lands, intending to make void the Letters Patents, becauſe the Defendant was <hi>nullius fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> And what difference there was in ſuch a Caſe, in Caſe of the King and a Common Perſon, was moved to the Court by <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> Serjeant. <hi>Dyer,</hi> Iuſtice, I conceive, That it is a good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in Law as well in the Caſe of the King, as in the Caſe of a Common Perſon. And ſee to that purpoſe, 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and in this Caſe, If the King had granted the Land to <hi>John Holt</hi> without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

him Son, the ſame had been a good Purchaſe: But if the King had called him <hi>John,</hi> the Son of <hi>Thomas,</hi> without giving him a ſirname, there ſuch a Purchaſe ſhould not be good, if he were a Baſtard; becauſe he hath not <hi>Nomen Cognitum,</hi> as where he hath a ſirname: and a Man cannot purchaſe by the Name of <hi>John</hi> only; and then if he be called <hi>John,</hi> the Son of <hi>Thomas,</hi> when he is not his Son, it cannot be good. And ſuch Caſe hath here lately been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, Where the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> gave certain Lands to <hi>Thomas Gray</hi> his Son, by him begotten upon the Body of <hi>Jane Orwell;</hi> and in truth the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> was a Baſtard of the ſaid Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> (and the name of <hi>Jane</hi> was not <hi>Orwell,</hi> but the Daughter of one <hi>Punt;</hi> and the Mother of <hi>Jane,</hi> who was firſt married to <hi>Punt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom <hi>Jane</hi> was begotten, married with one <hi>Orwell;</hi>) and yet notwithſtanding that wrong Name, and that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Gray</hi> was not the Son of the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> born of <hi>Jane Orwell,</hi> but of one <hi>Jane Punt;</hi> yet it was a good Purchaſe and Gift to <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> becauſe it was his known Name. <hi>Manwood,</hi> As I take it, the Letters Patents are <hi>Ex certa ſcientia, &amp; ex mero motu;</hi> and then the Kings Grant ſhall not be taken in ſuch plight as the Grant of a Common Perſon, void for incertainty, becauſe that the King takes notice of the Perſon, of what degree he is; and in the Kings Caſe, where he takes knowledge, by the words, <hi>Ex certa ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,</hi> there all matter of uncertainty ſhall be avoided and made good; but not matter which is not true: And for uncertainty, he ſaid, Where a thing may be taken two ways, there without the words, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia, &amp;c.</hi> the beſt ſhall be taken for the King, and ſtrongeſt againſt the Patentee. But by <hi>Dyer;</hi> by the words, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia, &amp;c.</hi> that incertainty is ſaved, and ſhall be taken ſtrong for the Patentee; and if it can any ways be taken for him, then the Patent ſhall not be void: and then when in the principal Caſe, there is the word (Son,) and the word (Son) may be taken two ways, either for a baſe Son, or a true Son; there by the words, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia,</hi> the King taketh upon him to know in what manner he is Son; and a baſe Son is a Son <hi>Quodam modo,</hi> ſo as the Letters Patents ſhall not be falſe: But where the King, in his Letters Patents recites a thing which is falſe, that ſhall not make the Patent good, although the words be, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia, et mero motu.</hi>

                  <p>THe Caſe was; The Husband levied a Fine of his Land, and died, and his Wife within the 5 years after the death of her Husband, brought her Writ of Dower, but did not purſue her Writ, until 6 years were paſt, and then ſhe would have revived her Suit. And <hi>Meade,</hi> Serjeant, demanded the Opinion of the Iuſtices, If the Wife ſhould be barred of her Dower, or not? And by <hi>Manwood,</hi> Iuſtice, it was moved again, If they at the Bar did agree, That if a Fine be levied by the Husband, and the Wife doth not make her claim within the 5 years, if for that ſhe ſhall be barred? And he conceived, That ſhe ſhould not be barred; For he ſaid, That he who hath Title to the Land at the time of the Fine levied, if he doth not ſue within 5 years after his Title ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued, ſhould be barred: But where the Title accrues after the Fine, there he who hath Title ſhall not be barred by the 5 years; but he may come 30 years after, and make his Title and Claim. But in the principal caſe he ſaid, That if the Fine had been levied after the death of the Husband, there the Wife ſhould be barred, if ſhe did not purſue her Right and Claim within 5 years: And he agreed, That if the 5 years be a Bar here, that then by the Wives ſuffering of her Writ of Dower to be diſcontinued till after the 5 years were paſt, that ſhe ſhould be barred, becauſe <hi>vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus &amp; non dormientibus ſubveniunt Leges. Harper</hi> ſaid, That the Diſcontinuance ſhould be no Bar unto her; For he ſaid, That if a gift be made to one in tail, the Remainder over, and Tenant in tail dieth without Iſſue, and he in the Remainder brings a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi> in the Remainder within 5 years, and diſcontinueth it, yet it is no Bar, but that after the 5 years ended, he may revive his Suit: Which <hi>Manwood</hi> denyed: And then <hi>Dyer</hi> came into the Court, and the Caſe was moved to him: And he ſaid, That the not proſecuting of the Action by the Wife, ſhould be a Bar unto her: and that the Marriage which was before the Fine, was the cauſe of Dower, although ſhe could not come to be endowed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after the death of her Husband: And he ſaid, That the Wife could make no other to have her Dower, but only by bringing of her Writ of Dower; and therefore if ſhe did ſurceaſe her time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the 5 years were paſt, that her new claim by her new Writ, would not revive the Ancient Claim, and that therefore ſhe ſhould be barred; For ſhe could not enter into the Land to defeat the Fine: And he ſaid, That as to the principal Caſe, That it was adjudged, <hi>Anno</hi> 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And it was alſo ſaid by the Court, That an Aſſignment of Dower made to the Wife in the Court of Wards, was no ſufficient claim of the Wife; becauſe ſhe cannot have a Writ of Dower there; and there by this ſurceaſing of her demand of her Dower for the 5 years at the Common Law, that ſhe ſhould be barred.</p>

                  <p>THe Caſe was; A Man made a Leaſe for years, and the Leſſee Covenanted to make Reparations; The Leſſor granted the Reverſion to another, and the Leſſee for years made his Wife his Executrix, and died: It was holden in this Caſe by the Court, That the Grantee of the Reverſion ſhould not recover damages, but from the time of the Grant, and not for any time before: But yet the Wife the Executrix ſhould be charged for the not Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well in the time of her Husband, as in her own time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if ſhe do make the Reparation, depending the Suit; yet thereby the Suit ſhall not abate, but it ſhall be a good cauſe to qualifie the damages according to that which may be ſuppoſed, that the party is damnified for the not repairing from the time of the purchaſe of the Reverſion, unto the time of the bringing of the Action.

                     <hi>LOvelace</hi> moved the Court, that in the Kings Bench this caſe was argued upon a Demurrer there; A Feoffment was made by one <hi>Coxley,</hi> who took back an Eſtate for life, the remainder to him who ſhould be his Heir at the time of his death, and to the Heirs males of his body begotten: And afterwards, the Tenant for life after the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſuffered a Recovery to be had againſt him, that that Recovery was good as it was at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, Becauſe the Statute doth not ſpeak but that it ſhall not be a bar to him who hath the Reverſion at the time of the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but this remainder was in Abeyance until the death of the Tenant for life; and that in the ſame Court it was adjudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in an <hi>Ejectione firmae;</hi> and becauſe the ſame was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance, the Plaintiff had here brought his <hi>Formedon</hi> in the Remainder; and therefore <hi>Lovelace</hi> prayed, That they might proceed without delays, (becauſe the Plaintiffs Title appeareth) without Eſſoigns, and feigned delays: Which <hi>Dyer,</hi> Iuſtice, conceived to be a reaſonable requeſt, and that it ſhould be well ſo to do; becauſe, as he ſaid, This Court is debaſed and leſſened, and the Kings Bench doth encreaſe with ſuch Actions which ſhould be ſued here, for the ſpeed which is there: And he ſaid, That the delays here were a diſcredit to the Court; ſo as all Actions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, which do concern the Realty, are determined in the Kings Bench in Writs of <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> where the Iudgment is, <hi>Quod recuperet terminum,</hi> and by that they are put into poſſeſſion; and

                  <p>THe Earl of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> ſeiſed of a Mannor, whereof the Demeſnes were uſually let for three Lives by Copy,<note place="margin">2 Len. 152. 2 Brownl. 208.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom of the Mannor, granted a Rent-charge to Sir <hi>William Cordell, pro conſilio impendendo,</hi> for the term of his Life, and afterwards conveyed the Mannor to Sir <hi>William Clifton</hi> in tail. The Rent is behind, Sir <hi>William Cordell</hi> dieth; Sir <hi>William Clifton</hi> dieth, the Mannor deſcended to Sir <hi>John Clifton,</hi> who granted a Copy-hold to <hi>Hempſton;</hi> The Executors of Sir <hi>William Cordell</hi> diſtrain for the Rent: And it was agreed by the whole Court, That the Copyholder ſhould hold his Copy-hold charged. <hi>Vide inde,</hi> 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 270. <hi>Windham,</hi> It hath been adjudged, That the Wife of the Lord ſhall not be endowed againſt the Copyholder, which <hi>Periam</hi> granted, and ſhewed a reaſon thereof; For the Title of Dower is not conſummated before the death of the Husband, ſo as the Title of the Copyholder was compleated before the Title of Dower; But the Title of the Grantee of the Rent is conſummated before the Dower. <hi>Fenner</hi> conceived, That the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors could not diſtrain upon the Poſſeſſion of the Copyholder; and he argued, That this Caſe is not within the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For by the Preface of the ſaid Statute, he conceived, That the Statute extended but to thoſe Caſes, for which by the Common Law, no remedy was provided; but in this Caſe the Executors by the Common Law might have had an Action of Debt, <hi>Ergo.</hi> But <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Windham</hi> held the contrary; For this Statute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a further remedy for that miſchief, <hi>viz.</hi> not only an Action of Debt, but alſo Diſſreſs and Avowry. See the words of the Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> diſtrain for the Arrearages, &amp;c. Vpon the Lands, &amp;c. which were charged with the payment of ſuch Rents, and chargeable to the diſtreſs of the Teſtator ſo long as the ſaid Lands continue, remain, and be in the ſeiſin or poſſeſſion of the ſaid Tenant in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne, who ought immediately to have paid the ſaid Rent ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind to the ſaid Teſtator; or in the ſeiſin or poſſeſſion of any other perſon or perſons claiming the ſaid Lands only by and from the ſaid Tenant by purchaſe, gift, or deſcent, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and form as their Teſtator might or ought to have done in his life time. It was moved by <hi>Fenner,</hi> That here the Land charged, doth not continue in the ſeiſin or poſſeſſion of the Tenant; And here Sir <hi>J. Clifton</hi> was iſſue in tail, and therefore he doth not claim only by the Father, but <hi>per formam Doni,</hi> and therefore he is not lyable, <hi>Ergo,</hi> nor his Heir. <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> contrary, Sir <hi>J. Clifton</hi> was chargeable, and he claims only from them who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ought to have paid the Rent. And the Copyholder claims by purchaſe from Sir <hi>J. Clifton,</hi> ſo he claims from Sir
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99485:37"/>
                     <hi>William Clifton</hi> the Tenant, although he doth not claim imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. For if the Tenant ought to have paid it, and he dieth, and the Land deſcendeth to his Heir, and the Heir maketh a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Feoffee ſhall be charged within this Statute; although he doth not claim immediately: So where Land diſcharged deſcends from the Tenant who ought to have paid it; and ſo from Heir to Heir. The Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. is, That all Grants, &amp;c. ſhall be good againſt the Donor, &amp;c. his Heirs, &amp;c. claiming the ſame only as Heirs to <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe;</hi> Yet if <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe</hi> grants a Rent-charge, and his Feoffees are diſſeiſed, the Grant ſhall be good againſt the Diſſeiſor, and yet he doth not claim only by <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe.</hi> And although Sir <hi>J. Clifton</hi> be Tenant in tail, and ſo claims <hi>per formam Doni,</hi> yet foraſmuch as the Eſtate tail comes under the Eſtate of him who grants the Rent, he ſhall be ſubject to the charge: And this Statute extends not only to him who claims by the Tenant, but alſo to the Heir of him, &amp;c. And by <hi>Windham,</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> The Copyholder doth not claim only by the Lord, but he claims in alſo by the Cuſtom; but the Cuſtom is not any part of his Title, but only appoints the manner how he ſhall hold. The poſſeſſion here is continued in Sir <hi>J. Clifton,</hi> for the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Copyholder is his poſſeſſion; ſo as if the Copyholder be ouſted, Sir <hi>J. Clifton</hi> ſhall have an Aſſiſe; And ſo the ſtrict words of the Statute are obſerved, for the ſeiſin and poſſeſſion continue in Sir <hi>J. Clifton,</hi> who claims only by Sir <hi>William Clifton,</hi> who was the Tenant in Demeſne who ought to pay the Rent. But <hi>Fenner</hi> ſaid to that, That the ſeiſin and poſſeſſion intended in the Statute, was the very actual poſſeſſion, <hi>i. e. pedis diſpoſitio,</hi> and ſuch a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in which a diſtreſs might be taken, and that could not be taken in a Freehold, without actual poſſeſſion.</p>

Then it is to be conſidered, How after the ſaid Grant, the ſaid <hi>Andrew Seymore</hi> is ſeiſed; And he conceived, That he ſhould be in of the ſaid Fee determinable, and not of an Eſtate in tail, againſt his own Fine; and then if he be not ſeiſed by force of the Tail at the time of the Fine levied, <hi>5 Eliz.</hi> the ſame Fine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bind the entail: But admitting, That at the time of the ſecond Fine levied, that he was in of an Eſtate in tail, yet that Fine ſhall not bar the Iſſue; For firſt, This Fine cannot make any Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, becauſe that the Reverſion in Fee is in the King, which is not touched by the Fine. See the Caſe of <hi>Saunders,</hi> Where <hi>A.</hi> makes a Leaſe for years, to begin at a day to come, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards levies a Fine to a ſtranger with proclamations, and the <hi>5</hi> years paſs, and afterwards at the day of the beginning of the ſaid Leaſe, the Leſſee enters; his Entry is lawful, and he ſhall not be bounden by the Nonclaim; and ſo it was adjudged in <hi>Saunders</hi> and <hi>Starkies</hi> Caſe. <hi>Vide inde <hi>Saffins</hi> Caſe, 3 Jac. Cook 5 Part, 123, 124.</hi> After the making of the Statute of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> of <hi>Fines,</hi> It was much doubted, If the Iſſues of Common Tenants in tail ſhould be bound by a Fine with proclamations, becauſe upon the death of their Anceſtors, they are as new Purchaſors <hi>per formam Doni.</hi> And therefore it was provided by <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> That the ſaid Statute of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> ſhould extend to ſuch Common entails; but there was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99485:45"/>
no doubt of an Eſtate tail of the gift of the King. And <hi>ſee Mich. 15 &amp; 16 Eliz. Rot. 1474.</hi> between <hi>Jackſon</hi> and <hi>Darcy,</hi> in a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titione facienda,</hi> the Caſe was, Tenant in tail, the remainder to the King, after the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> levied a Fine with procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and it was adjudged, That the ſame ſhould bind the Iſſues; The Act of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> doth not extend but where the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is in the King, but no mention is there of a Remainder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the words of the ſaid Act are general of all Tenants in tail; The makers of the Act perceiving, That it might be doubted, that the generality of the words might include all Eſtates tails of the gift of the King, they reſtrained the words in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; as appeareth by the laſt Proviſo of the ſame Act, Nor to any Fines heretofore levied or hereafter to be levied by any perſon or perſons of any Mannors, &amp;c. before the levying of the ſaid Fine, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, granted or aſſigned to the perſon or perſons levying the ſaid Fine, or to any of his or their Anceſtors in tail by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, or Act of Parliament, the Reverſion whereof at the time of the levying of ſuch Fine was in the King: And ſo ſuch Eſtates are excepted, And that in ſuch Caſes, where ſuch Fines are levied, they ſhall be of ſuch force as they ſhould be if the ſaid Act had not been made. And therefore it ſeemed to the ſaid Parliament, That ſuch Eſtate tails of the gift of the King were not bounden by the Statute of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> for otherwiſe, the ſaid Proviſo or Exception had been frivolous. <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> Serjeant, to the contrary; And he agreed, That the firſt Fine was not any Diſcontinuance; and yet he conceived it is not altogether void againſt the Iſſues before that they entred; For no right remains in the Conuſor againſt his Fine: And alſo he conceived, That this Clauſe, <hi>ex uberiori gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> did extend to paſs more than paſſed before; For he conceived, That the Queen intended more liberally, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reverſion; For this is not any matter of Prerogative, but the ſame is a matter of Intereſt, which might alſo in the Kings Caſe paſs out of the King by general words. <hi>See 3 H. 7. 6 &amp; 7 Br. <hi>Patents,</hi> 48.</hi> A Grant of the King <hi>ex inſinuatione,</hi> doth not hinder the force of the words, <hi>ex mero motu.</hi> And it was the Opinion of the whole Court, That the Reverſion which was in the King did not paſs by that Grant; For the whole ſcope of the Patent was, as he conceived, to grant only that which the King had then <hi>ratione attincturae. Anderſon</hi> conceived the Patent inſufficient, becauſe the Petition was not full and certain; Alſo he ſaid, That <hi>ex ſpeciali gratia, &amp;c.</hi> would not help this Caſe; For the Eſtate tail is not recited, but only that he was ſeiſed <hi>de Statu haereditario, &amp;c.</hi> ſo the Queen was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, &amp;c. <hi>Periam</hi> contrary, The Queen was adviſed of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and granted ſuch Eſtate with which he parted by the Fine. And as to the other Point, <hi>Walmeſley</hi> conceived, That the Fine with proclamations ſhould bind the tail: And as to the Objection which hath been made, That the Conuſor at the time of the Fine levied, was not ſeiſed by force of the entail; The ſame had been a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99485:45"/>
good matter to have alledged to avoid a Common Recovery in the Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe,</hi> but not to this purpoſe: For if there be Tenant in tail, and he levieth a Fine, although he was not ſeiſed at the time of the Fine levied by force of the entail, yet ſuch a Fine ſhall bind the iſſue; So if Tenant in tail diſcontinueth, and diſſeiſeth the Diſcontinuee, and ſo levies a Fine. And he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That the iſſue in tail is bound by the Statute of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> even of the Gift of the King. <hi>See 19 H. 8. 6 &amp; 7.</hi> Where it is holden, That the Iſſue in tail is bound by the Statute of <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> And where it hath been Objected, That it doth not extend but to ſuch Fines which make Diſcontinuance at the Common Law, The ſame is not ſo: For if Tenant in tail of a Rent, or Common, levieth a Fine with proclamations, it is clear, that the iſſues ſhall be barred by it. And he much relyed upon <hi>29 H. 8. Dyer, 32.</hi> Tenant in tail of the Gift of the King levieth a Fine, or ſuffereth a Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, although it be not a Diſcontinuance, becauſe that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is in the King; yet it is a bar unto the Iſſue. But Note, That that was before the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8. See <hi>Wiſemans</hi> Caſe, 27 Eliz. <hi>Cook</hi> 2 Part. And ſee the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Caſe, 7 Jac. <hi>Cook</hi> 8 Part, 78.</hi>

The Tenant ſaid, That the Lands lay in the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> where the Cuſtom is, That an Enfant might make a Grant or a Feoffment when he could number 12 <hi>d.</hi> and becauſe it is incertain when he could do it, It was holden to be a void Cuſtom. So 19 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>tit. Gard.</hi> 127. In a Raviſhment of Ward, It was alledged, that the Cuſtom was, That when an Enfant could meaſure an Ell of Cloath, or number 12 <hi>d.</hi> that he ſhould be out of Ward; And it was holden to be a void Cuſtom for the incertainty: Alſo he ſaid, That in the principal Caſe, the Cuſtom was void; for that it was againſt reaſon, that the Wife ſhould ſurrender to her Husband; for every Surrender is a Gift: and a Woman cannot give unto her Husband; for the Wife hath not any diſpoſing Will, but the Will of her Husband only. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Caſe is in 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. That if the Husband be ſeiſed of Lands in the right of his Wife; and he maketh a Feoffment in Fee of the Lands, and the Wife being upon the Lands doth diſagree, and ſaith, She will not depart with the Land during her life; yet the Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a good Feoffment, and ſhall bind the Wife during the life of the Husband. And <hi>ſee</hi> 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Br. tit. Deviſe,</hi> 43. That a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> cannot Deviſe to her Husband, for that ſhould be the Act of the Husband to convey the Lands to himſelf. And whereas the Caſe in 29 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was Objected againſt him, where the Caſe was, That a Woman being ſeiſed of Land deviſeable, took a Husband, and had Iſſue by him; and the Wife Deviſed her Lands to her Husband for his life, and died; and a Writ of Waſte was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought againſt him: And it was there holden, That the Writ did lie. He ſaid, That that Caſe did make rather for him than againſt him, for that Caſe proves, that the Husband did not take the Land by vertue of the Deviſe in his own right; but that he held the Lands having Iſſue by the Wife as Tenant by the Courteſie, and ſo under another Title; and therefore it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Writ of Waſte was there brought againſt him as Tenant by the Courteſie. Alſo he ſaid, That the Deviſe was void by the Statute of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. where it is Enacted, That Wills and Teſtaments made of any Lands, Tenements, &amp;c.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99485:48"/>
by Women Coverts ſhall not be good or effectual in the Law; and he ſaid, That that Statute did extend to Copyhold Lands: But as to that, all the Iuſtices did agree, That Copyhold Lands were not within the words of that Statute. But <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, That the Equity of that Act did extend to Copyholds: And further <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, That the Preſcription, or Cuſtom in the principal Caſe was not good; for it is layed to be, That <hi>Quaelibet Foemina Viro Co-operta poterit,</hi> and it ought to be <hi>poteſt;</hi> and by the Cuſtom have uſed to Deviſe to the Husband: And a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription muſt be in a thing done, and not <hi>in poſſe.</hi> Alſo he ſaid, That the Cuſtom if it were good, is not well purſued; For the Cuſtom is, that ſhe may Deviſe and Surrender in the preſence of the Steward and ſix Tenants, and that muſt be intended to be done all at one time; for the words of a Cuſtom are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if it may be: but in the principal caſe, the Deviſe is laid to be at one time, and the Surrender at another time, and ſo it is not in purſuance of the Cuſtom: But to that it was not anſwered. But then it was ſaid, Admit that the Cuſtom to deviſe, and the Deviſe were not good; yet the Action did not lie againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, becauſe that the Husband was admitted, and his Entry into the Land was countenanced by a lawful Ceremony; and alſo he was Tenant in Common with the other Husband by ſuch Entry. It was adjourned.</p>

after the Grant to Sir <hi>William Cordell,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> joyned in a fine <hi>Sur Conuſans de droit, &amp;c.</hi> to a ſtranger, who granted and rendred the Land to the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heirs, who deviſed the ſame to the ſaid <hi>Dorothy</hi> his Wife for life, the remainder to <hi>Cordell Savell</hi> in tail, the remainder over, and died; <hi>Dorothy</hi> entred, and died; <hi>Cordell Savell, 22 Eliz.</hi> conveyed the Mannor by Fine to one <hi>Williamſon,</hi> who entred; and afterwards and before the Treſpaſs aforeſaid, <hi>viz. 14 January, 23 Eliz.</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Defendant for years, by force of which the Defendant entred. And upon this Evidence, there was a Demurrer in Law. And it was argued by <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> who was made Serjeant the laſt Term. And he ſaid, That the Demiſe made by <hi>Henry Savell</hi> is not in the inconveniency of the maxim, that <hi>Henry</hi> by the ſaid Grant ſhould reſerve a leſſer Eſtate to himſelf, than he had before; For here by this Grant, no preſent intereſt paſſeth by Sir <hi>William Cordell,</hi> but the effect of the Grant reſts upon a Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency; <hi>ſcil.</hi> if he himſelf dieth within the Term, &amp;c. until which time the whole intereſt of the Term doth remain in the ſaid <hi>Henry Savell</hi> ſubject to the Contingency aforeſaid, and amounts to ſo much; as if the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> had granted the ſame to Sir <hi>William Cordell,</hi> if he himſelf ſhould die within the Term: in which Caſe, it is a limitation when the ſaid Grant ſhall take effect. As if I grant unto you my Leaſe for ſo many years as <hi>J.S.</hi> ſhall name, the ſame is a good Grant to take effect upon the naming of <hi>J.S.</hi> Then the Caſe being ſo, When <hi>Henry Savell</hi> the Leſſee, and <hi>Edward Savell</hi> the Leſſor joyn in a Fine, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> now the poſſibility of the remnant of the Term which upon the death of <hi>Henry Savell</hi> and <hi>Dorothy</hi> his Wife within the Term might accrue to the Executors of the ſaid <hi>Henry Savell,</hi> is not extinct by the Fine, but doth remain <hi>Quodam modo</hi> in <hi>Henry Savell,</hi> to veſt in his Executors, if it ſhould happen; And here is not any concluſion by the Fine in this Caſe; for <hi>Henry</hi> at the time of the Fine had not in him any Intereſt, which is now claimed, and ſo cannot be bound by the Fine: For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in reſpect of which the Plaintiff hath cauſe of Action, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> who levied the Fine; and firſt accrueth to his Executors, and ſo ſhall not be touched by the Fine: and therefore if ſuch a Leſſee for years granteth his Term to <hi>J.S.

                     <hi>Henry. Cook,</hi> contrary, And he held, The Grant to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cordell</hi> is utterly void; And he agreed, That Grants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in themſelves they be uncertain; yet if they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to certain, they are good: but here is no expectance of any certainty in the life of <hi>Henry;</hi> for the Term limited to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cordell,</hi> is not to begin till the death of <hi>Henry,</hi> and is to end upon the death of <hi>Dorothy,</hi> ſo as here is not any certain beginning, nor certain end; and here this Grant cannot be reduced to any Certainty during the life of the Grantor, and ſo for that cauſe is void, <hi>See Plow. Com. 6 Eliz. <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Fullers</hi> Caſe, 273.</hi> by <hi>Weſton,</hi> Iuſtice, If <hi>A.</hi> makes a Leaſe for ſo many years as <hi>J.S.</hi> ſhall name, if <hi>J.S.</hi> in the life of <hi>A.</hi> name a certain number of years, then the Leaſe is good; but if the Leaſe had been for ſo many years as my Executors ſhall name, that can never be made good in my life; And upon that reaſon it is, That an Attornment ought to be made in the life of the Grantor, or elſe no Reverſion ſhall paſs. So <hi>33 E. 3. Entry, 79.</hi> A Biſhop aliens, and after his death, the Dean &amp; Chapter confirms, it is a void Confirmation. And <hi>7 E. 6. Br. Grants, 154.</hi> A Man poſſeſſed of a Leaſe for <hi>40</hi> years, grants ſo many of the ſaid years which ſhall be to come at the time of his death, it is a void Grant for the incertainty. Afterwards, <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> moved another point, <hi>viz.</hi> The Plaintiff hath declared of a Treſpaſs done, <hi>1 Januarii, 23 Eliz.</hi> The Defendant ſhews in Evidence, a Leaſe for years to him made <hi>14 Januarii,</hi> the ſame year, which is <hi>13</hi> days after the Treſpaſs whereof the Plaintiff hath declared, and it ſhall not be intended that the Plaintiff had another Title than that which he hath alledged; and foraſmuch as he hath not diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in himſelf any Title <hi>Tempore tranſgreſſionis</hi> the Plaintiff ſhould puniſh him in reſpect of his firſt poſſeſſion without any other Title. And although it may be Objected, That where the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant hath given in Evidence, That <hi>Williamſon</hi> leaſed to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, that is not ſufficient; and the words ſubſequent <hi>14 Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii,</hi> are void as a nugation and matter of ſurpluſage; Truly, the Law is contrary; for rather thoſe words <hi>ante Tranſgreſſionem</hi> ſhall be void, becauſe too general, and ſhall give way to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent words after the <hi>videlicet,</hi> becauſe they are ſpecial and certain: As the Caſe late adjudged; The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> leaſed three parcels of Land, rendring Rent of <hi>8 l. per annum; viz.</hi> for one parcel, <hi>5 l.</hi> for another, <hi>50 s.</hi> and for the third, <hi>40,</hi> which amounts to <hi>9 l. 10 s.</hi> It was adjudged, That the <hi>videlicet,</hi> and the words ſubſequent concerning the ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Rent, was utterly void, becauſe contrary to the premiſſes, which were certain, <hi>viz. 8 l.</hi> and that the Fermor ſhould pay but <hi>8 l.</hi> according to the general reſervation: but in our caſe, the words precedent are general, <hi>i. e. ante Tranſgreſſionem,</hi> and therefore the words ſubſequent, which are ſpecial and certain, ſhall be taken, and the general words rejected; As in Treſpaſs, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleads, That <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed of the Land where, and held it of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99485:50"/>
the Defendant; and that the ſaid <hi>A. 1 die Maii, 6 Eliz.</hi> aliened the ſaid Land in <hi>Mortmain,</hi> for which he (within a year after) <hi>viz. 4 Maii, Anno 7 Eliz.</hi> entred, now the ſame is no bar; for upon the evidence it appeareth, that the Lord hath ſurceaſed his time, and the words, <hi>(within the year)</hi> ſhall not help him, for they are too general; and therefore, at the ſubſequent words <hi>(viz. &amp;c.) Cook</hi> on the Defendants part took Exception; For it appeareth here upon the Evidence of the Defendant, which is confeſſed by the Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Plaintiff, That upon this matter the Plaintiff cannot puniſh the Defendant for this Treſpaſs; for he was not an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Treſpaſſor to the Plaintiff; for the Plaintiff hath declared upon a Treſpaſs done <hi>1 Januarii, 23 Eliz.</hi> And it is given in Evidence on the part of the Defendant, and confeſſed by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, &amp;c. That <hi>22 Eliz. Cordell Savell</hi> levied a Fine to <hi>Williamſon,</hi> by force of which the ſaid <hi>Williamſon</hi> entred, and was ſeiſed; and ſo ſeiſed, <hi>14 Januarii, 23 Eliz.</hi> leaſed to the Defendant: Now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter the Plaintiff cannot have Treſpaſs, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; for <hi>Williamſon</hi> was the immediate Treſpaſſor to him; for he entred <hi>22 Eliz.</hi> And at length, after deliberation had of the premiſſes by the Court, The Court moved the Plaintiff to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his ſuit, and to bring <hi>de novo</hi> a new Action, in which the matter in Law might come into Iudgment without any other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.

And alſo in thoſe two Deviſes, a certain perſon is named in the Will, who ſhould take the reſidue of the Term which ſhould expire after the death of the Wife; but in the Caſe at Bar, no perſon in certain is appointed, &amp;c. but the Deviſe as to that is conceived in general words, <hi>Children unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; Ergo,</hi> neither any Poſſibility, nor any Remainder is in any perſon certain; therefore all the whole Term is intirely in the Wife, and then ſhe may well diſpoſe the whole. But the whole Court was to the contrary, and that in this Caſe the Poſſibility ſhould riſe well enough upon the death of the Wife, to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Alice</hi> unpreferred. Another Point was moved; If the ſaid Term being ſold in the poſſeſſion of the Wife of the Deviſor, by force of the Execution aforeſaid; If now the Iudgment being reverſed, the ſale of the Term ſhould be alſo avoided; for now the party is to be reſtored to all that which he had loſt. And by <hi>Cook</hi> it was
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99485:52"/>
argued, That notwithſtanding the reverſal of the Iudgment, the ſale ſhould ſtand; For the Iudgment for the Plaintiff in a Writ of Error is, That he ſhall be reſtored to all that which he loſt <hi>ratione Judicii praedict.</hi> and the Iudgment was, That the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff ſhould recover <hi>140 l.</hi> and therefore by the Iudgment in the Writ of Error, he ſhall be reſtored to ſo much; but the mean Act, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Sale of the Leaſe ſhall ſtand, and ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and avoided: As <hi>7. H. 6. 42.</hi> A Statute Staple is bailed in <hi>Owel Mayn,</hi> the Conuſee brings Debt againſt the Bailee, and hath Iudgment to recover the Statute, and upon that Suit he had Execution, and the Bailee brought a Writ of Error to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the Iudgment in <hi>Detinue,</hi> yet the Execution ſhall ſtand, and an <hi>Audita Querela</hi> doth not lie for the Conuſor. And <hi>ſee 13 E. 3. <hi>Fitz.</hi> tit. Bar. 253.</hi> Accomptant found in arrearages, committed to the Goal, eſcaped; and reverſed the Iudgment given againſt him in the Accompt <hi>Ex parte talis:</hi> yet an Action upon the Eſcape did lie. And as to that Point, the whole Court was of the ſame Opinion with <hi>Cook:</hi> But that Point did not come in Iudgment: For by the ſale, nothing paſſed but the Intereſt <hi>in praeſenti</hi> which was in the Wife of the Deviſor, but the Poſſibility to the Children unpreferred was not touched by it. And afterwards the Iudgment was affirmed.</p>

to parcel; And it was holden by <hi>Wray</hi> and <hi>Southcote,</hi> That the whole Writ ſhould abate, the whole Writ againſt all the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. And ſo where the Demandant enters into parcel of the Land in demand, if the thing in demand be an entire thing, the Writ ſhall abate in all. In this Writ, the Demandant ought to have averred in his Writ an eſpecial forepriſe of the Land parcel of the Land in demand whereof the Ioynt-Tenancy by the Fine is pleaded: For this diſmembring of the Mannor and diſtraction of the Land of which the Ioynt-Tenancy is pleaded, is paravail and under the gift whereof the <hi>Formedon</hi> is conceived; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reſpect of the title of the Demandant, it remains in right parcel of the Mannor, and therefore ought to be demanded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with a forepriſe.

                  <p>UPon an Evidence unto a Iury,<note place="margin">3 Cro. 353.</note> containing difficulty and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law; it was found, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich, 10 H. 8.</hi> was ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Northelman</hi> in the right of his Biſhoprick; and, at his Court holden within the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, granted parcel of the Demeſnes of the ſaid Mannor to one <hi>Taverner</hi> and his Heirs, where, of the ſaid Land in truth, there was not any Demiſe by Copy before: And ſo the ſaid Land continued in Copy until <hi>23 H. 8.</hi> at which time, <hi>Taverner</hi> committed a forfeiture; which being preſented, the Biſhop ſeiſed the Land as forfeited; and granted the ſame again by Copy to <hi>Taverner</hi> in Fee: And ſo from thence it continued in Copy until <hi>8 Eliz.</hi> (which Interval between 23 <hi>H. 8. and 8 Eliz.</hi> amounted to <hi>47</hi> years:) It was the Opinion of the whole Court in this Caſe, that the Continuance for <hi>50</hi> years, is requiſite to faſten a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Condition upon the Land againſt the Lord. It was alſo agreed by the Court, that although the Original Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that Cuſtomary Intereſt did commence <hi>10 H. 8. ut ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra,</hi> from which time, unto <hi>8 Eliz. 60</hi> years paſſed; yet the ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for a forfeiture which happened <hi>23 H. 8.</hi> interrupted utterly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99485:61"/>
the Continuance from the time which might by the Law have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Cuſtomary Intereſt. So that now, the time before the forfeiture ought not to be accounted in this Caſe: But the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal beginning of the Copyhold ſhall be holden to be <hi>23 H. 8.</hi> when the Grant <hi>de Novo</hi> by Copy was made; between which time, and <hi>8 Eliz.</hi> is an interval but of <hi>47</hi> years; within which time, a Cuſtomary Intereſt cannot be attached upon the Land: And then before ſufficient time encurred, &amp;c. the Lord may well enter upon ſuch a Tenant at Will: For as yet, there is not any Cuſtom begotten by ſufficient time to bind him. It was alſo agreed by the Iuſtices, That if the Lord of a Mannor is ſeiſed of an ancient Copyhold for forfeiture, or by reaſon of Eſcheat, and Lett the ſame at Will without any Copy for divers years, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, that that is not any Interruption of the Cuſtomary nature of the Land; but that the Lord may grant it again by Copy.</p>
                  <p>As to other parcel of the Land, It was given in Evidence, That at a Court lately holden at <hi>Northelman,</hi> It was preſented by the Homage there, That <hi>Taverner</hi> the Plaintiff being a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the ſaid Mannor, had forged a Cuſtomary of the ſaid Mannor, containing divers falſe Cuſtoms, pretending them to be true Cuſtoms of the ſaid Mannor, and that he had forged, and put a Seal to it, about which, this word, <hi>viz. (Northelman)</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven; And that he had procured divers Copyholders of the ſaid Mannor to ſet their ſeals to it; and that he ſaid unto them, <hi>That that Cuſtomary ſhould be put into the Church of <hi>Northelman</hi> amongſt the Charters and Evidences of the ſaid Church: And that he had now made his Copyhold as good as his Freehold.</hi> And, If the ſaid Offence committed by the Plaintiff, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> be a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Copyhold, was the Queſtion? It was argued by <hi>Popham,</hi> who was of Counſel with the Plaintiff, That without further matter, it was not any forfeiture; And yet he confeſſed, It is a forgery againſt the firſt branch of that Statute of <hi>5 Eliz. cap. 14.</hi> And ſo he ſaid it was lately adjudged in the <hi>Star-Chamber:</hi> But as to the point of Forfeiture, he put this difference; If the Lord demand his Services of his Copyholder, there, If the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholder upon debate between the Lord and himſelf, ſheweth forth ſuch a forged Cuſtomary, and Counterpleads the Demand of the Lord with it; now it is a forfeiture, for that the Inheritance of the Lord is thereby hazarded: As, if the Copyholder after the forfeiture keep it himſelf, and doth not encounter his Lord in his demand with it in his ſervices, the ſame is not any forfeiture: As, if the Copyholder, before any Rent be due, ſaith, <hi>That he will not pay any Rent to the Lord hereafter:</hi> Or when a Court is to be holden, <hi>That he will not after appear to do any Suit at the Court of his Lord, &amp;c.</hi> But if, his Rent being due, he denyeth it; Or when the Court is holden, he ſaith, <hi>That he will not do any Suit;</hi> the ſame is a foreiture: As it was lately adjudged in the <hi>Kings

Bench,</hi> in the Caſe between Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton,</hi> and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholders of his Mannor of <hi>Wellingborough.</hi> So if a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder being with the other Copyholders charged upon Oath to enquire of the Articles of the Court-Baron, and ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being given to them in Evidence, to induce them to find a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within their Charge, and they or any of them obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to find the ſame, the ſame is a forfeiture of his Copyhold; As it was adjudged in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Rich.

It was argued by <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Serjeant, who was of Counſel with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, to the contrary: For he ſaid, That if a Copyholder will forge a Deed of Feoffment, purporting, That the Lord of the Mannor hath enfeoffed him of the ſaid Cuſtomary Land, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he keepeth ſuch Charter himſelf, without ſhewing it forth, yet it is a Forfeiture. At the length, The Court wiſhed the Iury to find the ſpecial matter, and to refer the ſame to the Court, Whether it was a Forfeiture, or not. In this Caſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter was moved, <hi>viz.</hi> The Aunceſtor of the Plaintiff had purchaſed divers ſeveral Copyholds from ſeveral Copyholders by ſeveral Copies whereof he died ſeiſed; Or committed ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences by which he forfeited to the Lord all his Copyholds, for which the Lord ſeiſed, and granteth them again to his Aunceſtor wtih the Ancient Rent, and to his Heirs, <hi>Tenendum per antiqua ſervitia &amp; conſueta, &amp;c.</hi> And afterwards, the ſame Copyholder commiteth Waſte, whether the ſame ſhall now trench to forfeit all the Copyhold Lands which were granted <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> by one entire Copy; Or only that which was before the ſeizure holden by the ſame Rent, <hi>Et ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ultra:</hi> For theſe words, <hi>Tenendum per antiqua ſervitia,</hi> do not trench only to the Quantity of the Services, but alſo to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſeverally, ſo as there ſhall be ſeveral Services as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: As if <hi>A.</hi> be ſeiſed of Copyhold Land on the part of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of other Copyhold Land on the part of his Mother, and thereof dieth ſeiſed, and his Son and Heir be admitted to it by one Copy, and by one Admittance; Now if that Son dieth without Iſſue, the Copyholds ſhall deſcend ſeverally, the one to the Heir on the part of his Father, and the other to the Heir on the part of his Mother, &amp;c.

                     <hi>VIncent Lee</hi> ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, had Iſſue <hi>3</hi> Sons, <hi>F.G.</hi> and <hi>J:</hi> and by his laſt Will in writing Deviſed, That <hi>J.</hi> his Son ſhould have the Land for the Term of <hi>31</hi> years, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Waſte, to the intent that he pay certain Debts and Legacies ſet down in his ſaid Will, The remainder after the ſaid Term expired to the Heirs Males of the Body of the ſaid <hi>J.</hi> begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And further willed, That if the ſaid <hi>J.</hi> die within the Term aforeſaid, that then <hi>G.</hi> his Son ſhall have ſuch Term, &amp;c. and then alſo ſhall be Executor; but made the ſaid <hi>J.</hi> his preſent Executor, and died, <hi>J.</hi> entred by force of the Deviſe: <hi>F.</hi> died without Iſſue, by which the Feeſimple deſcended upon <hi>J.</hi> who had Iſſue <hi>P.</hi> and died within the Term, <hi>P.</hi> entred; <hi>G.</hi> as Executor entred upon him; and he re-entred; upon which re-entry, <hi>G.</hi> brought <hi>Treſpaſs. Pigott</hi> ſaid, That the Term by the deſcent of the Fee from <hi>F.</hi> to <hi>J.</hi> being the ſecond Son of <hi>Vincent,</hi> and Heir of <hi>F.</hi> is not extinct, but only ſuſpended. It hath been Objected, that <hi>J.</hi> cannot be ſaid to die within the Term, becauſe by the deſcent of the Fee, the Term is extinct, or ſuſpended, and ſo not <hi>in eſſe</hi> at the time of the death of <hi>J.</hi> therefore nothing did accrue to <hi>G.</hi> becauſe <hi>J.</hi> did not die within the Term: but that is but a Conceit; for the intent of <hi>Vincent</hi> was, that the Heir ſhould not meddle with the Land Deviſed as Heir, until the <hi>31</hi> years be expired: and words, <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> or <hi>Within the Term,</hi> extend unto the time of the Term, and not unto the Eſtate: And although, that the Term as to <hi>J.</hi> be extinct, yet the right or poſſeſſion of <hi>G.</hi> ſhall ſtand, and ſhall be expectant upon the death of <hi>J.</hi> before the expiration of the ſaid <hi>31</hi> years. As, <hi>A.</hi> leaſeth for life to <hi>B.</hi> and afterwards granteth the Reverſion with Warranty to <hi>C.</hi> who releaſeth to <hi>B.</hi> in Fee, who is impleaded in a <hi>Praecipe:</hi> although now <hi>B.</hi> hath a Feeſimple, yet during his life he ſhall not recover in value. And in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Caſe, This further Intereſt limited to <hi>G.</hi> cannot be extinct or prevented. <hi>See Plow. Com. <hi>Welden</hi> and <hi>Elkingtons</hi> Caſe. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> contrary. And that the Term is extinct, becauſe he hath the ſaid Term in his own right, and not as Executor, but as a Man truſted with payment of Debts and Legacies; But the ſame Term which <hi>J.</hi> had, <hi>G.</hi> cannot have, for ſome of the years are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; and the words of the Will are, <hi>He ſhall have ſuch Term;</hi> but here the Term is utterly extinct: As where a Rent, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or Way, &amp;c. deſcendeth upon the Ter-Tenant; <hi>2 H. 4.</hi> A Prior had an Annuity out of a Parſonage, and afterwards he purchaſeth the Advowſon, which is afterwards appropriated to his Houſe; now the Annuity is extinct; and although the Prior after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards preſenteth to the Advowſon, yet it is-not revived; <hi>Br.

Extinguiſhment, 54.</hi> A Man hath a Leaſe for years as Executor, and purchaſeth the Inheritance, his Term is extinct, yet it is Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, &amp;c. And it is ſaid in <hi>Bracebridges</hi> Caſe, <hi>Plow. Com. 419. 14 Eliz.</hi> that Parſon, Patron and Ordinary, Leaſe for years the Glebe Lands of the Parſonage; the Parſon dieth; the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee for years becomes Parſon and dieth, his Executors ſhall not have the reſidue of the ſaid Term; for the Term is extinct,<note place="margin">1 Inſt. 338. b. 2 Roll. 472.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had the Term in his own right, and the Freehold in the right of his Church; and ſo in ſeveral Capacities. And it was holden by ſome, that if the Term for years comes to the Leſſor as Executor, who dieth, the Term is revived. <hi>Manwood,</hi> Chief Baron, asked this Caſe of thoſe who Argued; A Leaſe is made for <hi>21</hi> years, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That the Leſſee ſhall ſuffer the Leſſor to enjoy the ſame, or to take the profits thereof during the life of the Leſſor, or ſo long as the Leſſor ſhall live; if the ſame were a good Proviſo, or not? <hi>Pigot</hi> Conceived, that the Deviſe to <hi>G.</hi> was a new Deviſe, and not dependant upon the firſt Deviſe to <hi>J.</hi> nor any parcel of it; but this ſecond Deviſe to <hi>G.</hi> did take away the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Deviſe to <hi>J.</hi> before, and qualified it, ſo as it determined with his death. The words, <hi>Such Eſtate,</hi> ſhall be intended an Eſtate to <hi>G.</hi> to be granted from the death of the Teſtator. Land is Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>A.</hi> and his Heirs, and he if dieth without Heir, that it ſhall remain to another; the ſame is no good Deviſe: But a Deviſe to one and his Heirs, and if <hi>J.S.</hi> dieth living the Deviſee, <hi>B.</hi> ſhall have it; the ſame is good: for it is a new Deviſe, and an Eſtate created <hi>de Novo,</hi> and doth not depend as a Remainder upon the firſt Deviſe, or upon the firſt Eſtate deviſed; as the Caſe is, <hi>29 Aſſ. 17. Br. Condition, 111. and Deviſe, 16.</hi> So here are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eſtates limited, one to <hi>J.</hi> and another to <hi>G.</hi> which Eſtate of <hi>G.</hi> cannot be extinct by unity of poſſeſſion in <hi>J.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>If he die within the Term,</hi> ſhall be conſtrued for Effluxion of the time of <hi>31</hi> years, and not for the Termination of the Term. <hi>Cooper,</hi> Serjeant, to the contrary; <hi>J.</hi> took this Term as purchaſor, and not as Executor, for that no Term was in the Teſtator. <hi>See 14 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 309. <hi>Granmer</hi>'s Caſe; G.</hi> ſhall have ſuch Term and Intereſt as before I have willed unto <hi>J. Manwood,</hi> Such Term, that is to ſay, The Reſidue of the Term.</p>
                  <p>Now at another day, the Barons delivered their Opinions, that the Plaintiff ſhould recover, and that was now <hi>G.</hi> to whom the ſecond Term was deviſed: And by <hi>Manwood,</hi> in Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Wills,</hi> all the words of the Will are to be compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as there by not any repugnancy between all the parts of the Will, or between any of them, ſo that all may ſtand: And the Intent of the Teſtator was, That his Son <hi>J.</hi> ſhould have the Lands for <hi>31</hi> years, if he ſo long lived, and if he died within the Term, That <hi>G.</hi> his Son ſhould have ſuch Term. And he held, That the ſame was in <hi>J.</hi> an Eſtate by Limitation, and he could not ſell it, nor could it be extinct by Act in Law, or of the Law. It was a Leaſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99485:63"/>
determinable by his death, and ſo ſhall be the Leaſe of <hi>G.</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable upon his own death; and <hi>G.</hi> upon the death of <hi>J.</hi> within the Term, ſhall have the reſidue of the number of the years limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the former Deviſe; <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſo many in number as were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in the life of <hi>J.</hi> who was firſt Executor to that ſpecial purpoſe. <hi>Gent,</hi> Baron, to the ſame intent; here he hath the ſame Term as Executor; and it is not like a-Term deviſed, which the party hath as Legatee; but in our Caſe, he hath only authority in this Leaſe as Executor, and the Land was tied to the time and the Authority; and when the ſame determines in his perſon, then the Land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from him to <hi>G.</hi> who was a ſpecial Executor to that purpoſe, as <hi>J.</hi> was before. And <hi>G.</hi> had not the ſame Term which <hi>J.</hi> had; but ſuch a Term. <hi>Clerk,</hi> Baron, acc. And he ſaid, that the Will was further, that if <hi>G.</hi> died before his Debts paid, and his Will performed; and the Iury finding all the ſpecial matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that if the Term limited to <hi>J.</hi> be extinct, then they find for the Defendant. And he held clearly, that <hi>J.</hi> had this Term of 21 years as Executor, and that by the diſcent of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to <hi>J.</hi> the Term as to himſelf was gone: But as to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors and to the Legatees, it ſhall be ſaid <hi>in eſſe,</hi> and be Aſſets in his hands: And becauſe that the Term as to that purpoſe ſhall be ſaid <hi>in eſſe,</hi> he died within the Term, within the intent of the ſaid Will. And this word, <hi>Term,</hi> is, <hi>Vox polyſema, Terminus ſtatus, Terminus temporis, Terminus loci.</hi> And in our Caſe, the word, <hi>Term,</hi> hath reference to time, and not to eſtate; for the Teſtator did reſpect the time in which his Will might be performed, and that was <hi>31</hi> years; as if I make a Leaſe during the Term that <hi>J. S.</hi> hath in the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> hath <hi>40</hi> years in it; now although that <hi>J S.</hi> ſurrendreth or forfeiteth it, yet he ſhall hold over, but he ſhall have it for <hi>40</hi> years; for my Leaſe refers to the time, and not to the eſtate. In the like manner here, <hi>G.</hi> cannot have the ſame Term which <hi>J.</hi> had, nor for <hi>31</hi> years after the death of <hi>J.</hi> but ſo much of the ſaid <hi>31</hi> years ſhall be cut off in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of it, as <hi>J.</hi> had enjoyed it; and <hi>G.</hi> ſhall have as many years as <hi>J.</hi> hath left; and <hi>G.</hi> ſhall perform ſo much of my Will as <hi>J.</hi> at his death within the Term aforeſaid ſhall not have performed: As if I Leaſe my Land to one until he hath levied <hi>100 l.</hi> and if he dieth before that he hath levied it, then <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall have ſuch Term for the levying of it: the firſt Leſſee levieth <hi>50 l.</hi> and dieth, <hi>J. S.</hi> may levy the reſidue, but not the whole. And although that the Iury ſaith, that if the Term be extinct, then they find for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant; although that it be extinct, yet they are not to take Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſance what the Law is thereupon: but that is the Office of the Iudges. As <hi>13 E. 3.</hi> the Iury found, that the Son was born du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Elopement, and ſo Baſtard; that Concluſion of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict is not to the purpoſe, but the Court ought to judge upon the premiſes of the Verdict, If upon the birth, during the Elopement, the party be Baſtard or not? And afterwards, <hi>Manwood,</hi> with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99485:63"/>
the aſſent of his Companions the Barons, Commanded, That Iudgment ſhould be entred for the Plaintiff; Which was done accordingly.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, It was agreed by all, That by the firſt words of the Will, the <hi>3.</hi> Deviſees had but an Eſtate for life: But <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Walmeſley</hi> who argued for the Plaintiffs, Conceived, That by force of the later words, <hi>ſcil.

Deviſees died without Iſſue, they never had any Inheritance in their two parts, and ſo thoſe two parts deſcended to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant as Heir to the Deviſor, no ſale being made by the Executor.

Then here the Feeſimple is determined by the death of the Deviſees without iſſue, and therefore the Land ought to revert to the Heir of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor, eſpecially being no perſon <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> who can ſell, for the Executor before ſale by him made, died Inteſtate; and if he had made an Executor, yet the Executor of the Executor could not ſell. Which ſee, <hi>19 H. 8, 9 &amp; 10.</hi> And afterwards Reſolved, That no eſtate tail is created by this Will, but the Feeſimple ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them, when they came at their lawful age, and had Iſſue; ſo as the reſidue of the Deviſe was void, and Iudgment was given accordingly.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99485:69"/>
better Condition than in a Subject, for the thing may diſtrain for a Rent-charge in all the Lands, of him who is ſeiſed of the Land out of which ſuch a Rent is iſſuing; and if a Rent-ſeck be due to the King, he may diſtrain for the ſame; and the King ſhall never demand his Rent which he hath reſerved with Clauſe of Re-entry; and it appeareth in the Regiſter, That if before the Statute of <hi>Weſtm. 3.</hi> the King purchaſeth parcel of the Land holden of him, the Rent ſhall be apportioned, which was not in the Caſe of a Common perſon, and there are in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> divers Preſidents to that effect, <hi>ſcil.</hi> If <hi>A.</hi> be bounden in a Recognizance to <hi>B.</hi> and afterwards enfeoffeth the King of part of his Land, and <hi>C.</hi> of the other part: If <hi>B.</hi> be afterwards attainted of Treaſon, ſo as the ſaid Recognizance accrueth to the King; that now, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he hath part of the Land lyable to the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, he ſhall have Execution of the reſidue.

And he ſaid, That this Grant before Office retorned was not good; for without Office the King cannot enter, <hi>multo minus</hi> his Patentee; and that the King by the Grant hath interrupted the Relation of the Office, As if a Man by Indenture bargaineth and ſelleth his Lands, and afterwards makes Livery to the Bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee, and afterwards the Deed is enrolled. Now the party ſhall not be ſaid to be in by the Bargain and Sale, but by the Livery; for the Livery hath interrupted the force of the firſt aſſurance by way of Bargain, and the Relation is utterly gone: So in our Caſe, The Grant of the Queen, mean between the Award of the Commiſſion, and the Retorn of it, hath deſtroyed the force and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Commiſſion, ſo as no appearance ſhall be had of it: And he agreed, That here are ſeveral Rents, but the Condition is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and admit, that a Condition may be apportioned in ſome Caſes, yet in ſome Caſes it cannot. And the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> gives the Condition and the Reverſion, to which it is annexed, to the King, in ſuch ſort as it was in the Prior: But the Condition in the Prior was not capable of Apportionment, and therefore no more it ſhall be in the Caſe of the King.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99485:70"/>
Rents, and ſo ſeveral Conditions, eſpecially when all the things demiſed are of ſuch a Nature, that they may yield a Diſtreſs: but if any of the things demiſed cannot yield Diſtreſs, then it ſhall be one entire Rent, and ſhall iſſue out of the Reſidue, &amp;c. Which ſee, <hi>17 Aſſ. 10.</hi> An Aſſiſe was brought of <hi>20</hi> s. Rent, and the ſaid Rent was reſerved upon a Leaſe for life made of <hi>100</hi> Acres of Lands, and <hi>15</hi> Acres of Wood; <hi>ſcil.</hi> for the Land <hi>10</hi> s. and for the Woods <hi>10</hi> s. And by the Aſſiſe it was found the Diſſeiſin in the Wood, but not in the Land. Wherefore it was awarded, That the Plaintiff ſhould recover ſeiſin of the <hi>10</hi> s. and for the reſidue, that he ſhould take nothing. And although theſe words <hi>(reddendo inde) Trench unto all the things demiſed entirely,</hi> yet this word <hi>(viz.)</hi> is a diſtributive, and makes an Apportionment; And the <hi>viz.</hi> is not contrary to the premiſſes; <hi>ſcil.</hi> to the <hi>reddendo inde.</hi> As if I enfeoffe <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> of an Acre of Land, <hi>Habendum</hi> the one moyety thereof to <hi>A.</hi> in Fee, and the other moyety to <hi>B.</hi> in Fee; this is good, for it well ſtands with the premiſſes. But if I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffe <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> of two Acres of Lands, <hi>Habendum</hi> the one Acre to <hi>A.</hi> and the other to <hi>B.</hi> the ſame <hi>Habendum</hi> is void, becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the premiſſes, for each of them is excluded out of one Acre which was given to him in the premiſſes. And in our Caſe, If the Rent ſet forth in the <hi>(Viz.)</hi> had been greater or leſs than that which is reſerved upon the <hi>Reddendo,</hi> then the <hi>(Viz.)</hi> ſhould be void for the contrariety, and the <hi>Reddendo</hi> ſtand. <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> contrary; And that here is one entire Rent. Which ſee to be ſo, by the cloſe of the Condition, <hi>Si Redditus praedict' aut aliqua inde parcella, &amp;c.</hi> And the Leſſor may diſtrain in any part of the Land demiſed for the whole Rent, notwithſtanding the <hi>(Viz.)</hi> And it was moved by <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> That admit the Rent and Condition be entire; Yet now when the King grants the Reverſion of one of the things demiſed in Fee to a ſtranger, the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and not determined by the deſtruction of the Reverſion, as in the caſe of a Subject: For the King hath divers Prerogatives, by which he is exempted and protected from ſuch Miſchiefs and Inconveniences which happen to Subjects by their own Acts and their Laches and Folly, which ſhall not be imputed to the King; And the reaſon of Extinguiſhment of a Condition in ſuch caſe in the caſe of a Common perſon, is his own Folly, that he will <hi>diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> his Reverſion; And Folly ſhall never be imputed to the King: And as the Caſe is here, the King is not bound to take notice of a Condition made by a Common <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erſon; For it is not matter of Record, and by this Grant of the King, the Rent doth not paſs; for the Grant is only of the Reverſion, without any mention of the Rent. And the King hath divers Prerogatives in a Condition; As in the creating of a Condition, <hi>35 H. 6. 38.</hi> The Abbot of <hi>Sion's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Ad effectum,</hi> is a good Condition in the Caſe of the King, by <hi>Priſon:</hi> And where the King grants Lands in Fee to one upon Condition, That the Grantee ſhall not alien, the ſame is a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99485:70"/>
good condition. So for a Rent-Seck, the King may diſtrain; And the King may reſerve a Rent and a Condition to a ſtranger; and if he doth reſerve a Rent and a Condition to himſelf, he may grant the ſame over to a Subject, <hi>2 H. 7. 8.</hi> And the Condition in the caſe of a Common perſon may be apportioned: As if Leſſee of two Acres upon Condition, alien one of them in Fee, and the Leſſor entreth for the forfeiture, or recovereth part in an <hi>Action of Waſte, &amp;c.</hi> but of a ſurrender, it is otherwiſe. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> contrary; The Condition is gone; For a Condition in the hands of the King is of the ſame Nature, as in the caſe of a common perſon, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of any Diviſion, Partition, or Apportionment: As, if the King hath a Rent out of <hi>3</hi> Acres of Land, and afterwards pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth one of them, the Rent is utterly gone, and ſhall not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned as well as in the Caſe of a common perſon: So of a Common. And as this Caſe is, If the Condition doth remain, then, upon the breach of it, the King ſhall enter into the whole; for the words of the Condition are, <hi>Wholly to re-enter;</hi> and ſo he ſhould defeat his own grant. And he cited a Caſe adjudged at the Aſſizes at <hi>York;</hi> The King gave Land in Fee-Farm, rendring Rent, with Clauſe of re-entry: The King granteth the Rent over to a ſtranger; And after, the Rent is behind; The King cannot re-enter, nor the Grantee.</p>

Rep. 33. 1 Len. 35. 4 Len. 61.</note>THe Caſe was this, In <hi>Anno 4 &amp; 5</hi> of King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> A private Act of Parliament was made, by which it was Enacted, That the Mannor of <hi>Burnham</hi> was aſſured to the Counteſs of <hi>Suſſex</hi> for her Ioynture; with a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Act, That it ſhould be lawful for the Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi> to may a Leaſe or Leaſes for <hi>21</hi> years; and afterwards, a year before the firſt Leaſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99485:72"/>
was ended, he made another Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, and this ſecond Leaſe was to begin and take effect from the end of the firſt Leaſe. And if this ſecond Leaſe were a good Leaſe within the intent and meaning of the Act, was the Queſtion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> the Queens Attorny General ſaid, That it was not; <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe it was a Leaſe to begin at a day to come: And, <hi>2.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was made before the firſt Leaſe was ended. But he ſaid, It may be Objected, That the Act ſaith <hi>(Leaſe or Leaſes,)</hi> It is not the ſenſe of the Act, that he might make Leaſes in the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but the ſenſe and meaning of the Makers of the Act, was, That he might make Leaſes in poſſeſſion, and not Leaſes <hi>in futuro;</hi> for if it ſhould be ſo, then he might make a Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin after his death: which ſhould be a great prejudice to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and againſt the meaning of the Act, which was made for her advantage.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Treaſurer, and Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> Knight, have a Commiſſion from the Queen to make Leaſes of the Queens Lands for <hi>21</hi> years, becauſe the Queen would not be troubled. It was holden, That by virtue of that Commiſſion, they could not make any Leaſes, but Leaſes in poſſeſſion only: But all other Leaſes which did exceed the Term of <hi>21</hi> years, and in Reverſion, were to paſs by the hands of the Queen, and her Attorny Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not by them only by virtue of their ſaid Commiſſion. And if I grant to one power before the Statute to make Leaſes of my Land for <hi>21</hi> years, he cannot make any Leaſe, but only Leaſes in poſſeſſion; and he cannot Leaſe upon Leaſe, for by the ſame reaſon, that he might make one Leaſe to begin <hi>in futuro;</hi> by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he might make <hi>20</hi> ſeveral Leaſes to begin <hi>in futuro;</hi> and ſo fruſtrate the Intent of the Act. It was <hi>Marſhall's</hi> Caſe upon the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of Leaſes to be made by Biſhops; The Biſhop of <hi>Canturbury</hi> made a Leaſe to him for one and twenty years; and afterwards he made a Leaſe unto another for <hi>21</hi> years to begin at the end of the firſt Leaſe. And it was holden, That the ſecond Leaſe was void. But in the great Caſe which was in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> upon this Point, There the ſecond Leaſe was in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to begin preſently, and to run on with the other Leaſe; and therefore it was adjudged to be good, becauſe the Land was charged with more than <hi>21</hi> years in the whole. And if the Earl had done ſo here, it had been a good Leaſe. <hi>Wray,</hi> Iuſtice, ſaid, That if the ſecond Leaſe had been made but two or three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the expiration of the firſt Leaſe, that then it had been utterly void; but being made but <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> days or months before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the firſt Leaſe, he doubted, If it ſhould be void, or not. The Statute of <hi>32 H.</hi> 8. makes Leaſes for <hi>21</hi> years, to be good from the day of the date thereof: And a Leaſe was made to begin at a day to come: And yet it was holden by two of the Iuſtices in the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> That it was a good Leaſe: And by two other Iuſtices of the ſame Court, it was holden, the Leaſe was
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99485:73"/>
not good. And <hi>Clench,</hi> Iuſtice, ſaid, That there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, If it be by one Deed, or by two Deeds: And therefore he held, That if the Earl had made a Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year another, the ſame had been void, if it were by one Deed, or two Deeds, for that he did exceed his authority. And he ſaid, In the principal Caſe, If there had not been a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> he could not have made a Leaſe; and therefore the <hi>Proviſo</hi> which gave a power to make a Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, ſhould be taken ſtrictly. There was a Caſe of the Lord Marqueſs of, &amp;c. that it ſhould be lawful for him to make Leaſes for <hi>21</hi> years by a Statute; And he made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Leaſe to begin after the end or expiration of the firſt Leaſe; and it was doubted, Whether it were a good Leaſe or not, becauſe he had not made any Leaſe before: But if both were made by force of the Statute; all held, That the ſecond Leaſe was void.</p>
                  <p>At another day, the Caſe was argued by <hi>Daniel,</hi> for the Leaſe in Reverſion to begin at a day to come. And he ſaid, That in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the words alone are not to be conſidered, but alſo the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the parties, and they are not to be ſevered. Alſo he ſaid, That a Statute-Law is to be expounded by the Common-Law: And by the Common-Law, If one giveth power unto another to make Leaſes of his Lands, he might make Leaſes in Reverſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Authority is to be taken moſt beneficially for them for whoſe cauſe it was given. So that if a Man grant an authority to another to make Eſtates of his Lands, by thoſe general words he may make Leaſes for years or for life, Gifts in tail, Feoffments, or any Eſtates whatſoever; If one gives a Commiſſion to another to make Leaſes for one and twenty years of his Lands, he may make a Leaſe in Reverſion; and ſo it was holden in the Dutchy in the Caſe between <hi>Alcock</hi> and <hi>Hicks.</hi> Alſo he ſaid, That this Leaſe was a good Leaſe by the Statute-Law: For the Statute of <hi>Rich. 3.</hi> gives authority to <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe,</hi> that he may make Eſtates in Reverſion. The Statute of <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> which gives au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the Chief Officer of the Court of Surveyors to make Leaſes, if it had ſtayed there, he might have made Leaſes in Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Therefore the Statute goes further, and ſaith, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That he ſhall not make a Leaſe in Reverſion. <hi>See 19 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 357.</hi> The Statute of <hi>35 H. 8.</hi> of Leaſes to be made by the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of the Lands of their Wives, By the general words of the Statute they might have made Leaſes in Reverſion; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Caſe there was, That where the Husband had made a Leaſe of his Wives Lands for <hi>21</hi> years; and afterwards he made another Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, to begin after the Leaſe <hi>in eſſe:</hi> It was conceived, That ſuch a Leaſe was good, becauſe in the Act there was no reſtraint of Leaſes in Reverſion, as there is in the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all Caſes of Statutes which are with <hi>Proviſoes,</hi> the Law upon them ſhall be taken generally, but in ſuch Particulars only as are reſtrained by the <hi>Proviſo;</hi> and here in this Caſe, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:99485:73"/>
went to the Ancient Rent to be reſerved, and that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs ſhould have remedy for the ſaid Rent; and therefore it ſhall be conſtrued at large as unto all other points which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if the Wife be within age, and ſhe and her Husband joyn in a Leaſe, yet ſuch a Leaſe ſhall be good, by the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> becauſe the Law is general, and doth not reſtrain theſe imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons expreſly. So if a Feoffment in Fee be made with warranty, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> That he ſhall not vouch; yet that reſtraint goes to the Voucher only, and he is at large to Rebutt, or to have a <hi>Warrantia Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae.</hi> A Leaſe is made for life, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That he ſhall not do volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Waſte; he is at large to do any other Waſte: Otherwiſe it would be, if there were no <hi>Proviſo,;</hi> and there a <hi>Proviſo</hi> makes the precedent words to be expounded more liberally. The Stat. of <hi>33 H. 8. Cap. 39. of Surveyors,</hi> which giveth authority to the Chief Officer to ſet, or let for <hi>21</hi> years, he might have made a Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, if by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> he had not been reſtrained; and yet the words are put ſingularly: But the words of this Act, upon which the Caſe in Queſtion doth ariſe, are <hi>Leaſe or Leaſes;</hi> and therefore it ſhall be expounded moſt liberally for the party.</p>
                  <p>Again, he argued, That as to the intent of the Statute, that this Leaſe was within the meaning of it; for the meaning is to be collected out of the words, and ſhall not be drawn to any private conſtruction or intent againſt the words, which ſhould be here, if this Leaſe ſhould be avoided: For by ſuch conſtruction and expoſition, the Earl, his Heirs, Executors, &amp;c. ſhould be prejudiced, and the Counteſs only ſhould be benefited. Alſo by this Act remedy is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Counteſs againſt ſuch Leſſees, that ſhe ſhould have the Rent, by Debt, or Diſtreſs; as if ſhe had been party or privy: therefore it is reaſon, <hi>via verſa,</hi> that the Leſſees have remedy againſt her for their Leaſes. Alſo he ſaid, That the ſame remedy ſhould be for them againſt the Counteſs, as they had againſt the Earl himſelf if he had been alive; and therefore they ſhould have ſuch remedy againſt the Counteſs, as they had againſt the Earl. And further he ſaid, That the Statute is to be expounded according to the words where ſuch an Expoſition is not rigorous, nor miſchievous: And private Laws are to be expounded by the letter, and ſtrictly, as the Deed of the party ſhall be. As <hi>14 E 4. 1. Br. Parliament, 61.</hi> A Particular Act was made, That the Chancellor calling unto him one Iuſtice, might award a <hi>Subpena</hi> between <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and end the matter betwixt them: And there, by all the Iuſtices, except <hi>Littleton,</hi> He ſhall not award a general <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pena,</hi> but a ſpecial <hi>Subpena,</hi> making mention of the Act; for he ſhall purſue the particular Act ſtrictly: But an Act which is for the common profit, ſhall be expounded largely. Alſo a Statute ſhall not be expounded largely, or by Equity to overthrow an Eſtate. As the Statute which gives, That if the Woman doth conſent to the Raviſher, that the next Heir ſhall enter: If the Daughter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth; and after a Son is born; he ſhall not put out the Daughter,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99485:74"/>
becauſe the Statute ſhall not be drawn to a private intent, to the overthrow of the Eſtate before lawfully veſted in the Daughter: And ſo in the principal Caſe, the Statute ſhall not be drawn to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intent for the benefit of the Counteſs, to overthrow the Leaſe for years. And it is not like to the Caſe which hath been put, That if he maketh a Leaſe for <hi>20</hi> years, and ſo for <hi>20</hi> years; that the ſame is not good by the Statute; For I will agree, That that is a Leaſe for <hi>40</hi> years. <hi>Egerton,</hi> Sollicitor, contrary; Firſt, as to the word (<hi>Demiſe,</hi> or <hi>Dimiſſion,</hi>) it is nothing elſe but the letting of the Land, and ſo <hi>(Leaſe)</hi> comes from <hi>(Laiſer)</hi> a <hi>French</hi> word; and ſuch a Leaſe it ſelf, for he hath not left the Land. As if I ſay to you, <hi>I Let you my Lands for 21 years;</hi> When ſhall you have my Land? Not at a day to come, but preſently. If I ſell you Land, and Covenant, that it is diſcharged of another Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, and there is a Leaſe to Commence after the Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, I have broken my Covenant. If I be bounden to make you a Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, and I ſay to you, <hi>I make you a Leaſe to begin <hi>200</hi> years hence,</hi> I have forfeited my Bond. If the Cuſtom of the Mannor be, that <hi>Dominus pro tempore</hi> may make a Leaſe for <hi>21</hi> years, may he make a Leaſe to begin at a day to come? Truly no, if there be not a ſpecial Cuſtom ſo to do. If I give authority to my Steward to make Leaſes of my Lands for <hi>21</hi> years, he cannot make a Leaſe to begin <hi>100</hi> years after. As to the Caſe of the <hi>Dutchy,</hi> there the Commiſſion was, That he might make Leaſes according to his diſcretion, therefore there he might make what Leaſe he pleaſeth. As to the Statute which enableth <hi>Ceſtuy que Uſe,</hi> of <hi>1 R. 3.</hi> that Caſe is not like to our Caſe, for that Act is, <hi>All Feoffments, Eſtates, &amp;c.</hi> therefore he might make ſuch Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without doubt. And if I deviſe, That my Executors ſhall make Leaſes of my Lands for <hi>21</hi> years, they cannot make Leaſes to begin at a day to come; and if they do not make the Leaſes within convenient time, the Heir ſhall enter, and avoid their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>And Statute-Law ſhall have ſuch an Expoſition, as that the preciſe time ought to be obſerved; As the Statute of <hi>14 E. 3. <hi>Raſtal</hi> Voucher, 8.</hi> If the Tenant voucheth to warranty a dead Man, and the Demandants will aver, That the Vouchee is dead, or that there is no ſuch, their Averment ſhall be received without more delay. Vpon this Statute the Caſe was, <hi>21 E. 3.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one was vouched to warranty, and the <hi>Summoneas ad Warranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zandum</hi> iſſued, and then came the Demandant and would have averred, That the Vouchee was dead; And the Tenant ſaid, That he ought to have averred that upon the voucher to warranty, and that now he had ſurceaſed his time: And the Demandant ſaid, That the Statute did not bind him to that, nor did preſcribe any time, but left the ſame generally. Yet it was the Opinion of the whole Court, That he ſhould have the Averment at the time of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99485:74"/>
Voucher, or not at all. So the Statute of <hi>11 H 7. Cap. 20.</hi> If a Woman who hath a Ioynture for life or in tail, ſuffereth a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and afterwards the Iſſue in tail releaſeth all his Right by Fine, and dieth, his Iſſue may enter; for the aſſent ought to be by Voucher in the ſame Action, or the like: for if there be a mean inſtant between the Recovery and the Aſſent, then any aſſent after is nothing to the purpoſe; for the Recovery being once void by the Statute, cannot be made good by an aſſent afterwards. <hi>See Doctor and Student, 54.</hi> And yet the Statute is, <hi>Provided, That the Statute ſhall not extend to any ſuch Recovery, &amp;c. if the next Heir be aſſenting to the ſame Recovery, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as the ſame aſſent, or agreement be of Record, or inrolled. And it doth not ſay, That the Aſſent ſhould be at one time, or at another. But to come to Leaſes upon Statutes. Before the Statute of <hi>2 E. 6. Cap. 8.</hi> If Leaſes had not been found by Offices, the Leſſees ſhould have been <hi>ouſted,</hi> and put to their traverſe: But put Caſe, that after that Statute, a Leaſe made to begin at a day to come, were not found by Office, ſhould it be helped by that Statute? No truly; And ſo it is holden in the Court of Wards at this day; and the Lord Chief Iuſtice of <hi>England</hi> held ſo in his Reading at <hi>Lincolns-Inn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Statute of <hi>1 Eliz.</hi> of Leaſes to be made by Biſhops, is, That Leaſes other than for <hi>21</hi> years from the time that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; that is, when they may take effect as Deeds, and not when they ſhall take effect to be executed; For ſo they might make Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes infinite, &amp;c.

And the Plaintiff in bar of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſans, ſhewed, That the ſaid <hi>Fowke</hi> being ſeiſed of the ſaid Rent, granted the ſame to one <hi>Horden, &amp;c.</hi> Vpon which Grant they were at Iſſue: And the Iury found, That the ſaid <hi>Fowke</hi> being ſeiſed of the ſaid Rent, by Indenture reciting, That whereas a Fine was levied between <hi>Fowke</hi> and <hi>7</hi> others Plaintiffs, and <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> and <hi>Rutland</hi> Deforceants; as the reſt <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> granted <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum praedict.</hi> to <hi>Horden;</hi> and further found, that no other Fine
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99485:75"/>
was levied between the parties aforeſaid but the ſaid Fine, and that the parties to the Fine were ſeiſed of the Mannor at the time of the Fine levied, and of no other Land: And if this Rent ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the ſaid Indenture, ſhould paſs or not, was the Queſtion? And it is to be obſerved, That the Indenture of Grant between <hi>Fowke</hi> and <hi>Horden,</hi> recited a Fine of the Mannor of <hi>Coleſhall inter alia,</hi> where the Iury have found, That the Fine was levied of the ſaid Mannor only. And it was argued by <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> That the ſaid Rent did not paſs to <hi>Horden</hi> by the ſaid Indenture; for the Rent, beſcribed by the Indenture, is not the Rent which was granted by the Fine: And if I let Lands for years to <hi>A.</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>A.</hi> grants the Land which <hi>B.</hi> holds of me, the Grantis void; As <hi>13 E. 3. Grants, 63.</hi> Land is given to Husband and Wife for their lives; And the Leſſor grants the Reverſion of the Land which the Husband holdeth for life, nothing paſſeth. <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> contrary; The variance in the Fine ſhall not avoid the Grant; For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture of the Rent agrees with the Fine, in the Term, in the year of the Reign, and in the name of the parties to the Fine, in the quantity of the Rent, and in the Land charged; the only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in the phraſe of Law, Deforceant for Plaintiff; and it is granted, that that is but a matter of Circumſtance, and not of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Snag,</hi> Serjeant, contrary. And firſt he took Exception to the Verdict; for this, that a ſpecial Verdict is given upon a ſpecial <hi>Abſ<expan>

And ſo it was adjudged in the Caſe between <hi>Vavaſour</hi> and <hi>Doleman. Fenner</hi> argued, as <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> The Grant agrees with the Fine in the points of greateſt importance, and one falſity ſhall not prejudice it where there are ſo many verities which may induce the Court to judge, That the Rent granted by the Indenture, is the Rent created by the Fine: and in a Fine, the ſubſtance is not, Who was Deforceant, who was Plaintiff; but who was party to the Fine? And that ſome of the parties to the Fine were ſeiſed of the Land of which the Fine is levied: And if the Indenture had been, Whereas ſuch a Rent was granted by a Fine levied between <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> without ſhewing who was Plaintiff, and who Deforceant, it had been good enough. And although that in this Caſe, the Plaintiff and Deforceant are miſ-ſet down, yet the ſame ſhall not make the Grant void; for <hi>utile per inutile non vitiatur.</hi> So if I reciting, The Original Grant was made to me by Indenture <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite</hi> between <hi>A.</hi> of the firſt part; <hi>B.</hi> of the ſecond part; and my ſelf of the third part; whereas the Indenture it ſelf is, Between myſelf of the firſt part, the ſame is not material, &amp;c. For, ſuch a ſmall miſtaking ſhall not avoid the Grant. So if I by my Deed reciting, That whereas I am poſſeſſed of certain Lands for Term of years of the Demiſe of Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton,</hi> Knight, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of <hi>England;</hi> whereas in truth he is Chancellor; that miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Dignity ſhall not prejudice the Grant. And it was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99485:75"/>
Agreed by all the Iuſtices, If the ſaid Fine had been pleaded at it is recited in the Indenture, miſtaking the Plaintiff and Deforceant; he who had ſo pleaded it, had failed of his Record; But in the Caſe at Bar, the reciting who was Plaintiff, who Defendant, was matter of ſurpluſage, and therefore it ſhall not hurt the party.

in this Caſe, That the Son and Heir of the Son, ſhould not avoid this Recovery by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

                     <hi>A Writ of Error</hi> was brought by <hi>Payn,</hi> Treaſurer of the Records in the Kings-Bench, in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> upon a Iudgment given in the Court of the Exchequer for the Queen, upon an Aſſignment of a Leaſe for years by the Counteſs of <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Queen; One Error was aſſigned, becauſe whereas the Iſſue was joyned upon the Intruſion, and the taking of the profits, and ſo two matters put in Iſſue; and the Iury have found <hi>Payn</hi> guilty of the Intruſion; but have ſaid nothing of the taking of the profits, and ſo the Verdict doth not meet fully with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99485:79"/>
the Iſſue. The great matter of the Caſe was upon this Point; The Information is, That the Aſſignment of the Queen was, 16 <hi>Maii,</hi> the Intruſion 17 <hi>Maii,</hi> the Inrollment of the Deed of Aſſignment 18 <hi>Maii;</hi> And ſo it appeared upon the Record, that the Intruſion is ſuppoſed to be done before that the Queen had any Intereſt in the Land in which the Intruſion is ſuppoſed, for nothing was in the Queen before the Enrollment: For the Queen is a Corporation of State, of ſuch Prerogative and Excellency, That ſhe cannot give or take an Intereſt in Land without matter of Record; And this Leaſe is a Chattel-real, and an Intereſt in Land. <hi>See as to the Inrollment,</hi> 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30. 31. 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 7. 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 16. But I agree, That if Leſſee for years be Outlawed, the Leaſe ſhall be in the King without Office, for the <hi>Outlawry</hi> it ſelf is a ſufficient Record to entitle the King unto it. If the Queen makes a Leaſe for years of Lands rendring Rent, with a Clauſe, That if the Rent be behind, that the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe, if the Rent be not paid. It was agreed here in Sir <hi>Moile Finch's</hi> Caſe, That the Leſſee continuing his poſſeſſion, ſhall not be accounted an Intruder before Office thereof found, but he ſhall be Accomptant to the Queen for the profits as Bailiff of his own wrong: but here we are charged with Intruſion.</p>
                  <p>It hath been doubted, If perſonal things are in the King without Office, 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. But now it is clear they are. As 35 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Br. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogat.</hi> 113. The Villein of the King purchaſeth goods, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof is in the King without ſeiſure; and ſo it is of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Chattels, becauſe they are tranſitory, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26. And here it appeareth upon the Record, that this Deed of Aſſignment was delivered to Baron <hi>Clark,</hi> 16 <hi>May,</hi> at <hi>Weſtm.</hi> and that was <hi>Aſcenſion-day,</hi> and ſo <hi>non dies Juridicus,</hi> and ſo no Court there then holden, and then the ſaid Deed was not delivered in Court of Record, and then not delivered to him as a Iudge, but as a private perſon, although that it was delivered to the uſe of the Queen. But in 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. there is ſome Opinion, That if ſuch a Deed be delivered in Court to one of the Barons, or be put into the Kings Coffers, that then it is a Record.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atkins,</hi> to the contrary: And to the firſt Exception, It is to be known, That in every Plea where a Contempt is laid to the charge of the Defendant, he ought firſt to excuſe his Contempt: And therefore here the <hi>Exordium</hi> of the Plea is, <hi>Quoad venire vi &amp; armis, &amp; quicquid eſt in Contemptu Dominae Reginae, necnon de tota ulteriore tranſgreſſione &amp; Contemptu per ipſos ſuppoſit. Quod ipſe in nullo eſt inde Culpabilis:</hi> And afterwards plead over: And ſo it is in an Action of Treſpaſs. And alſo upon the Statute of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. of <hi>Forcible Entry;</hi> and here the Iſſue upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt doth enſue the other Iſſue; For if the other Iſſue is found againſt the Defendant, ſo alſo is this. As to the other point I agree, That a Corporation cannot take or ſpeak without writing:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99485:80"/>
And the King being a Corporation, and who only makes Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cannot take but by writing of as high a nature; <hi>ſcil.</hi> by Record: And we have here a Record (as is granted by the other ſide) being enrolled 18 <hi>May,</hi> which was delivered 16 <hi>May;</hi> and being once enrolled, it hath relation to the time of the delivery; <hi>i. e.</hi> to 16 <hi>May;</hi> And then <hi>Payn</hi> upon the whole matter was an Intrudor 17 <hi>May:</hi> and an Intrudor by his Entry doth not gain any thing againſt the Queen; and therefore the Information of the Intruſion is, <hi>diverſis diebus &amp; vicibus intruſit;</hi> althought it be but one continued poſſeſſion; and therefore every Inſtant during his poſſeſſion, he is an Intrudor. As to the delivery of the Deed of Aſſignment upon the day of the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> which is not <hi>dies Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridicus,</hi> that is not material. As 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. by <hi>Pigot,</hi> If the day of Retorn of a Writ, <hi>i. e.</hi> 4<hi>
                        <hi rend="sup">to</hi> die,</hi> falls upon a Sunday, it is good enough, although no Court can then be holden but the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Plea is not diſcontinued; And this delivery of the Deed of Aſſignment might be made out of Term there upon any day in the Term which is not <hi>dies Juridicus.</hi> Contrary, where the thing is of neceſſity to be done in the Term; as in the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Brocket,</hi> of Proclamations made upon a Fine; For a Man may acknowledge a Recognizance or a Deed to be enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the time of Vacation, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tanfield,</hi> As to the Intereſt, the Enrollment hath relation, not as to the profits; for <hi>Payn</hi> cannot be Intrudor 17 <hi>May,</hi> by any Relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> The Queens Attorny, When an Information of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion and taking of the profits is here exhibited, the Defendant ought to juſtifie his Entry; and if the Entry be found againſt him, ſo as his Entry is an Intruſion, then the illegal taking of the profits is found alſo. And he ſaid, That the Deed acknowledged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Baron, is a Record, although not enrolled, be the acknowledgment thereof in Court, or out of Court. If an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation upon a penal Law be exhibited to a Baron of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer out of Court, and afterwards another Informer exhibits ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Information upon the ſame Statute for the ſame Offence againſt the ſame perſon, and that is exhibited in the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt; The firſt Information ſhall be preferred, and the Defendant ſhall anſwer to that, and not to the other: and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the ſame in Court, or out of Court, it is not material. And the Aſſignment when it is enrolled, hath relation unto the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of it. A Reverſion is granted to one for life, the Remainder to the King; the particular Tenant attorns to the King, the Remainder is not in the King by the Attornment; but if the Deed be afterwards enrolled, it ſhall be ſaid to be in the King from the time of the Attornment: And the King ſhall have the benefit of all the mean profits from the time of the Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Leaſe for years is made by the King, reſerving Rent, with a clauſe, That if the Rent be not paid, that the Leaſe ſhall
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99485:80"/>
be void: the Rent is not paid 10 years, after an Office is found, the King ſhall be anſwered all the profits from the time of default in payment of the Rent. And although no Intruſion can be laid in the Information 17 <hi>May,</hi> yet it ſhall be good for the 18th day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cook,</hi> The Iudgment for the Queen upon an <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>Intruſion,</hi> is, <hi>Quod defendens, de Intruſione, tranſgreſſione, &amp; Contemptu praedict. convincatur, &amp;c.</hi> And afterwards, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhall iſſue forth, for to enquire of the Mean profits, and there the Defendant may ſhew this matter in taking of the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: And if the <hi>Intruſion</hi> be at any time in the <hi>Information,</hi> it is ſufficient enough to have Iudgment upon it: and in our Caſe, the Continuance is laid 18 <hi>May.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egerton,</hi> Sollicitor, The Record warrants the Iudgment given upon it; For poſſeſſion laid in the Queen, is ſufficient to this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> And here <hi>Payn</hi> doth not anſwer the Queens title, but traverſeth the Intruſion, And therefore he being found Intrudor by Verdict, Iudgment ought to be given upon it. For the Iury have found the Intruſion generally, and ſpecially, 17 <hi>May.</hi> And that cannot be aſſigned for Error; for it is part of the Verdict, of which Error doth not lie, but Attaint: For if any Error was, it was in the Iury, and not in the Court. Which <hi>Manwood Conceſſit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tanfield,</hi> As to the Caſe of Continuance of an Intruſion, it is clear, That every continuance ought to have a beginning; for a thing, which hath no beginning, cannot be continued; and here is not any beginning: for the beginning which is laid in the <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is pretended to be 17 <hi>May;</hi> and that cannot be, <hi>cauſa qua ſupra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> If an <hi>Information</hi> be brought of an <hi>Intruſion,</hi> where in truth there is not any Record to prove it, and the Iury find the <hi>Intruſion,</hi> ſhall you have a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> upon it?

And the Iury found further, That <hi>Francis</hi> died without Iſſue; and that afterwards <hi>Thomas</hi> died, <hi>Robert</hi> being his next Heir; And that <hi>14 Eliz. Anne</hi> clearly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>London,</hi> and went to <hi>Melton</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk:</hi> And that afterwards <hi>Robert</hi> before any <hi>Entry,</hi> releaſed unto <hi>Anne;</hi> and afterwards againſt his Releaſe entred. It was argued for the Defendant, That by this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> and the departure of <hi>Anne</hi> out of <hi>London,</hi> the Freehold was not out of her, and veſted in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> before the entry of <hi>Robert;</hi> For if it were out of <hi>Anne,</hi> then is ſhe but Tenant at ſufferance, to whom a Releaſe made cannot enure; And the words of the Will are not, That her Eſtate ſhall ceaſe. And here as the caſe is, <hi>Anne</hi> cannot be Tenant at ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to him in the Remainder, betwixt whom and her there is not any privity. <hi>See 18 E. 4. 25, 26.</hi> Tenant for the term of the life of another, the Remainder over in Fee, <hi>Ceſtuy que vie</hi> dieth; The Tenant remained Tenant until he in the Remainder entred upon him.

                     </hi> (but it doth not ſtay there) <hi>and dwell in the Country, &amp;c.</hi> And here it is found, That ſhe clearly departed out of <hi>London;</hi> but they have not found, that ſhe dwelt in the Country, &amp;c. but only that ſhe went to <hi>Melton;</hi> but ſhe ought to do doth before her Eſtate ſhall ceaſe. It was argued by <hi>Towſe</hi> for the Plaintiff, That the Defendant ought to be found guilty of the Ejectment; For it is found, That the Defendant entred before the Commandment of <hi>Anne;</hi> but they have not found, that <hi>Anne</hi> was alive.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1 Cro. 386.</note> Another matter argued by him, was, becauſe at the time of the Grant, the Lands were in extent, and ſo the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> had but a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, If therefore the ſaid Grant, made during the Extent, was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99485:84"/>
good? And he argued, That it was; for it is more than a bare poſſibility, for it is an Intereſt veſted: And in ſome Caſes, a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility may be granted. As <hi>19 H. 6. 2.</hi> The King granted to a Prior, That when any Tenth is granted to the King by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, his Houſe ſhall be diſcharged of it, &amp;c. And <hi>19 E. 2.

So <hi>21 E. 4. 44.</hi> A Grant unto an Abbot to be diſcharged of the Collectorſhip of Tenths when it ſhall be granted by the Clergy. It hath been Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That the Term for <hi>99</hi> years is ſuſpended, therefore it cannot be granted during the ſuſpenſion. But the ſame is not ſo; for, a thing ſuſpended may be granted: As <hi>15 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 319.</hi> Husband and Wife Ioynt-Tenants of Lands in Fee, The Queen having a Rent out of it in Fee, giveth the Rent to the Husband and his Heirs; now the Husband Deviſeth the ſaid Rent, and dieth; the ſame is good a Deviſe, notwithſtanding the ſuſpenſion: And he cited the Caſes, <hi>16 E. 3. Quid juris clamat, 22. And 20 E. 3. <hi>ibid.</hi> 31.</hi> A Leaſe is made to one for life; and if he dieth within <hi>20</hi> years, that his Executors and Aſſigns ſhall hold the Land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the expiration of the <hi>20</hi> years, the ſaid Intereſt may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which <hi>Wray,</hi> Chief Iuſtice, denyed. <hi>See <hi>Gravenors</hi> Caſe, 3 &amp; 4 Ma. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 150.</hi> ſuch Intereſt is void. It was further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, and argued, If the Conuſee of the Fine might avoid the Leaſe made to Sir <hi>Thomas Cotten?</hi> And he ſaid, He could not; for he is in under the Leſſors. So is <hi>34 E. 1. Recovery in value, 36.</hi> ſee the Caſe there. And here, although the Wife after the death of her Husband may affirm, or diſaffirm the Leaſe at her Election; yet this Election is not transferred to the Conuſee by the Fine; but the Conuſee ſhall be bound by the Fine. <hi>See 33 H. 8. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 51.</hi> As Tenant in tail makes a Leaſe for years not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Statute, and dieth, the Iſſue alieneth the Land by Fine, before affirmation or diſaffirmation of the Leaſe by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or Entry, the Conuſee cannot avoid this Leaſe; for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is not transferred. Which <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Iuſtice, <hi>conceſſit.</hi> And Election cannot be transferred over to the prejudice of another perſon. As if a Rent <hi>de novo</hi> be granted to the Father in Fee, who dieth before Election, the Heir cannot make it an Annuity to defeat the Dower of the Wife, <hi>quod Curia conceſſit.</hi> It was alſo moved by <hi>Brantingham,</hi> If the Leſſee might enter upon the Conuſee of the Statute after his Extent expired, without ſuing forth a <hi>Scire facias:</hi> But the Court diſcharged him from arguing that Point; for that by the Death of the Lady <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> the Extent was void; and therefore the Feoffee or Conuſee might avoid it by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And ſo <hi>Wray,</hi> Chief Iuſtice, ſaid, it had been adjudged in the Court of <hi>Common Pleas.</hi> At another day, the Caſe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by <hi>Stephens</hi> on the part of the Plaintiff; who ſaid, That the Extent by computation of time according to the value to which it was extended, is not yet ſatisfied: The Verdict hath found, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99485:84"/>
the <hi>Extent</hi> continued until <hi>22 Eliz.</hi> hut doth not ſay, that it was then expired and ended. And I conceive alſo, that this Extent doth not evict the Intereſt of Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton,</hi> or turn it into a poſſibility; The extent is <hi>Quouſ<expan>

Which ſee, <hi>15 H. 7. 16.</hi> by <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Where a Man is bounden by Statute to pay <hi>40 l.</hi> and the Conuſee ſueth Execution upon it, and the Land extended is rated at <hi>10 l. per annum:</hi> now it ſhall be intended, by a common intent, that in <hi>4</hi> years the party may be ſatisfied; and therefore after the <hi>4</hi> years the Conuſor ſhall have a <hi>Scire facias:</hi> ſo upon the matter it is a Leaſe for <hi>4</hi> years. So <hi>7 H. 7. 12.</hi> by <hi>Keble</hi> to the ſame purpoſe. And <hi>15 E. 4. 5.</hi> by <hi>Brian;</hi> for the Law ſhall not intend a caſualty without alledging of it; for the ſame ſhall not be by imagination. And therefore, If the Conuſor will have the Land within the Term, he ought to alledge, That the Conuſee hath levied the duty by an extraordinary Caſualty, and ſhew it ſpecially. And ſo where the Conuſor ſueth a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and the Conuſee will hold the Land over, he ought expreſly to ſurmiſe ſome extraordinary occaſion wherefore he could not levy the duty upon the Land within the Term: Which ſee by <hi>Brian, 15 E. 4. 5. and 44 E. 3.</hi> The Conuſee of a Statute after extent maketh a Leaſe for <hi>3</hi> years; yet it may be that the duty ſhall be levied within one year; but if it be ſo, then a <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall iſſue forth againſt the Conuſee, and not againſt the Leſſee; for the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that the whole eſtate of the Conuſee is not granted, but that he hath a Reverſion in him; but if he hath granted his whole eſtate, then a <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall iſſue forth the Grantee. So here, although that this extent in our Caſe would continue by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of time for ſome of the years of the Term granted to Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton:</hi> yet it is intended, that the extent did run out, and was determined before the expiration of Sir <hi>Thomas Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi> Term; ſo as, notwithſtanding that, Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> hath an Intereſt left in him which he may grant. It will be Objected, How can it be ſaid an Eſtate for years, when as he might hold over the years? As to that, ſuch an Intereſt may be put off in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Caſes; As, <hi>15 H. 7.</hi> A Man grants to another the third Avoidance of ſuch a Church, and dieth ſeiſed, his Wife is endowed of the Church, ſhe ſhall have the third Avoidance, and the Grantee ſhall have the <hi>4th</hi> Avoidance, and ſo <hi>per talem intervenientem occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem,</hi> the benefit ſhall be delayed; and ſo here in our caſe: And then the eſtate by Extent being <hi>prima facie</hi> certain, ſo as it cannot by intendment ſurmount the Term of Sir <hi>Tho. Cotton,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth upon the Extent; the eſtate ſhall be taken to continue according to the extent of the years, and then a certain Intereſt doth remain in Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton,</hi> which he may grant over, which is not a poſſibility, but rather a Reverſion: So, and to ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is the Caſe of <hi>7 H. 5. 3 &amp; 4.</hi> If the eldeſt Son entreth after the death of his Father, and afterwards his Mother recovereth
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99485:85"/>
Dower, that ſhall take away the <hi>poſſeſſio fratris;</hi> but if the Son maketh a Leaſe for life, and the Wife recovereth Dower againſt the Leſſee, there ſhall be <hi>poſſeſſio fratris,</hi> for the Reverſion doth remain in the Leſſor, notwithſtanding the eviction of the eſtate for life. And <hi>7 H. 6. 2.</hi> there it is holden by <hi>Goddard</hi> and <hi>Strange,</hi> That where the Term of the Wife was extended upon the Statute of the Husband, who died, the Wife ſhall have the reſidue of the Term, and avoid the extent as to her Term, which proves that all the Term is not drawn to the Conuſee by the Extent, but that an Intereſt doth remain in the Leſſee notwithſtanding that. And ſee by <hi>Seton, 29 Aſſ. 64.</hi> If Leſſee for life Leaſeth to him in the Reverſion for life, yet he hath a Reverſion in him, And <hi>31 Aſſ. 6. A.</hi> is bound by Statute to <hi>B.</hi> and his Land extended by force of it: <hi>C.</hi> recovers againſt <hi>B.</hi> in Debt, and the Land extended by him upon the Statute,<note place="margin">1 Roll. 887.</note> is now extented by <hi>Elegit; A.</hi> grants his Eſtate to the Conuſee, it is no ſurrender; which proves, that <hi>B.</hi> hath an Intereſt. And ſo in our Caſe, an Intereſt doth remain in Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton,</hi> notwithſtanding the Extent. <hi>A.</hi> makes a Leaſe for years to begin at a day to come, and before the day, <hi>A.</hi> is diſſeiſed; The Leſſee notwithſtanding this Diſſeiſin, may grant his Intereſt, for he never was in poſſeſſion, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned into a Right.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond point, If <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> may enter within the time of the Extent, without a <hi>Scire facias:</hi> and that reſts upon this point; If this Leaſe ſhall be ſubject to the Extent? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive clearly, that it ſhall not. It hath been ſaid, That our Leaſe is not good: But I conceive it without queſtion, that our Leaſe is good enough; For it is made by the Husband and Wife: and the Wife after the death of her Husband by Acceptance of the Rent, might affirm the Leaſe: But the Statute is the act of the Husband alone; therefore the Conuſee of the Fine ſhall not avoid the Leaſe, for it is but voidable. So the King grants Lands <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante beneplacito,</hi> and afterwards grants the Reverſion over, the Patentee ſhall not avoid the Eſtate; But if this Leaſe had been made by the Husband only, it had been void, and then the Conuſee of the Fine ſhould avoid it; as it was lately adjudged in <hi>Harvy</hi> and <hi>Thomas<hi>'s</hi>
                     </hi> Caſe. And I conceive, That if Tenant in tail ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a Statute, and afterwards makes a Leaſe according to the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> and dieth, the Leſſee ſhall not hold the Land ſubject to the Statute, for then the Rent ſhould not be paid to the Iſſue in tail during the Statute, which is againſt the Stat. of <hi>32 H. 8. And ſee alſo, 8 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 252.</hi> The Chaplain of a Donative Chappel Leaſed for <hi>99</hi> years, which was confirmed by the Patron, who was Tenant in tail of the Patronage which was appendant to a Mannor, whereof he was ſeiſed in tail; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he had Iſſue, and died; The Statute of Chauntries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; after the death of the Incumbent, the King ſhall avoid this Leaſe. And in our Caſe, after the Coverture, the Conuſee is in

by the Wife, and then he ſhall avoid the Statute extended upon it: And if ſo, then there needeth not any <hi>Scire facias;</hi> as the Iſſue in tail may enter upon the Conuſee of a Statute acknowledged by his Father; For if Execution had been ſued againſt the Iſſue in tail, it had been a Diſſeiſin. And ſee <hi>2 R. 3. 7.</hi> That in ſuch caſe, the Wife, or her Heirs, may enter upon the Conuſee; And by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the Conuſee who is in by her, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cook,</hi> contrary; I conceive, that this Grant of this Leaſe by Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> to his Son, is not good;<note place="margin">2 Roll. 48; 1 Cro. 15. 1 Inſt. 22. b.</note> for it is but a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and no Intereſt: I agree all the Caſes which have been put before, for Law, but they cannot be applyed to this Caſe; The Book in <hi>7 H. 6. 2.</hi> is, That if the Term of the Wife be extended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statute of the Husband, that the Wife ſhall have the reſidue after the death of the Husband; but it doth not ſay, that the Wife or her Husband may grant it during the Extent; which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now in Queſtion. And I conceive, That Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> hath but a poſſibility; For the Conuſee upon the Extent hath but an incertain Intereſt: And although it may be by ſome means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a certainty in the Chancery, where the Coſts and Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhall be aſſeſſed; yet until it be reduced to a certainty, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be granted. And therefore it is clear, That if I have a Term for <hi>8</hi> years in Land, and grant it unto another until he hath le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied <hi>100 l.</hi> and all his Coſts of ſuit for it, by this Grant all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Term is in the Grantee, and nothing is in me, but a poſſibility.<note place="margin">8 Co. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings Caſe.</note> And ſo it was holden in the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> by the Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> the day when he was made Chief Iuſtice there, At which time, this Caſe was put; Lands of the yearly value of <hi>20 l.</hi> are Leaſed to one until he hath levied <hi>100 l.</hi> And the matter was, What eſtate the Grantee hath? And it was holden, That if Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very be not made, that he hath but an eſtate at Will, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Lands are incertain, the one year more, and the other year leſs: And <hi>Bromley,</hi> Lord Chancellor was then of the ſame Opinion. Then, if in caſe of a Leaſe it be ſo, it ſhall alſo be ſo in caſe of an Extent; and in both the Caſes, the whole Intereſt is out of the parties. And <hi>19 Eliz.</hi> the Caſe was in this Court, That the Leſſee for years deviſed his Term to his Executors for the payment of his Debts and Legacies; and after the payment of them, the reſidue of the years he deviſed to his Son: The Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors enter, which is an aſſent to the remainder; he in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grants his Intereſt: And it was holden void, becauſe it was but a poſſibility, and ſo incertain: and although it might be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a Certainty afterwards, yet the ſame is not ſufficient; for it ought to be reduced to a certainty at the time of the grant. And <hi>17 Eliz.</hi> in this Court the Caſe was, That Land was given to the Husband and Wife, and to the Heirs of the Husband; the Husband makes a Leaſe for years, and dieth; the Wife enters, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marrieth with the Leſſee: And it was moved, If the Intereſt of the Leſſee by the entermarriage, was extinct? And it was holden, That
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99485:86"/>
it was not; for it was but a poſſibility, and not an Intereſt, <hi>quod fuit conceſſum per totam Curiam.</hi> And if a poſſibility cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, then it cannot be granted. And he denyed the Caſe put by <hi>Stephens,</hi> Where a Man ſeiſed of Lands Leaſeth the ſame for years to begin at a day to come, and afterwards before the day, the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor is diſſeiſed; now during that Diſſeſin, the Grantee cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his future Intereſt; For the Feeſimple being turned into a Right, ſo alſo ſhall be the Intereſt. And that is proved by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamere's</hi> Caſe, A Feoffment in Fee was made to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> for life, and afterwards to the uſe of <hi>C.</hi> for life, and afterwards to the uſe of <hi>D.</hi> in Fee; and afterwards <hi>A.</hi> enfeoffed a ſtranger, who had notice of the uſe; The ſame doth take away all the other uſes; and ſaid Feoffee although he had notice of the uſe, yet he ſhall not be ſeiſed to the firſt uſe, for the eſtate out of which the firſt uſes do ariſe, is taken away; and then alſo the uſes. And he ſaid alſo, That the Leaſe made to Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> is not good; for it was made, <hi>11 Eliz.</hi> And it is found by Verdict, That <hi>10 Eliz.</hi> a <hi>Writ of Extent</hi> iſſued forth upon the Statute, then was the Lands in the hands of, &amp;c. during which time, the Lord <hi>Mount joy</hi> and his Wife could not make the Leaſe aforeſaid to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton.</hi> And as to that, <hi>ſee 5 E. 3. Retorn of the Sheriff, 99. See the Caſe of 3 E. 6. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 67. <hi>Stringfellow</hi>'s Caſe.</hi> Then admitting the Leaſe to Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton,</hi> yet the Leſſee cannot put out the Conuſee without a <hi>Scire facias;</hi> for the Conuſee is in by matter of Record. Alſo here, this Leaſe made by the Husband and Wife without any Rent reſerved, is utterly void, and then the Conuſee ſhall take advantage of it, <hi>9 H. 7. 24 18 E. 4. 2.</hi> And ſo was it ruled in the Caſe of <hi>Seniori puero,</hi> in the caſe of an Enfant. And ſee <hi>7 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 239.</hi> Where the Provoſt of <hi>Wells</hi> being <hi>Parſon imperſonee</hi> of the Patronage of <hi>W.</hi> Leaſed the Tythe for <hi>50</hi> years, rendring Rent, which was confirmed by the Dean and Chapter, but not by the Patron and Ordinary: And afterwards by Act of Parliament, the Provoſtry was united to the Deanery <hi>cum primo vacare contigerit;</hi> The Provoſt died, the Dean accepteth the Rent; The ſame ſhall not bind the Church, for the Leaſe is void, as it is of a Parſon, or Prebend, &amp;c. And ſo the Dean ſhall take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, although not privy to it. <hi>See 16 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 337.</hi> Lands given to a Parſon and his Succeſſors for to find Lights, and he Leaſeth the ſame for life; The Rent is ſo imployed accordingly: The Incumbent dieth, The Succeſſor accepteth the Rent; the King grants it over, The Patentee ſhall avoid the Leaſe, as the Succeſſor might have done before the Statute, if he had not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Rent: but the acceptance before the Statute ſhall bind the Succeſſor, for that it was but a voidable Leaſe. And the Caſe between <hi>Harvy</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> which hath been put on the other ſide, ſerves to our purpoſe, for there the Conuſee ſhall avoid a Leaſe in Law which is void; and here, in the Principal Caſe, the Leaſe is void; for that no Rent is reſerved upon it. Wherefore, &amp;c. It was adjourned.</p>

And <hi>Stanhops</hi> Caſe was remembred by the Court; which was, That <hi>Edward Stanhop</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> brought an <hi>Action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Caſe</hi> againſt one who had Reported, That the ſaid <hi>Edward Stanhop</hi> had gained his Living by ſwearing and forſwearing; And by the Opinion of the Court, The Action did not lie; for thoſe words do not ſet forth any actual forſwearing in the perſon of the Plaintiff; but it might be in an Action depending between the Plaintiff and a ſtranger, that another ſtranger produced as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had made a falſe Oath, without any procurement or practice of the Plaintiff; in which Caſe, it might be, that the Plaintiff had gained by ſuch ſwearing.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99485:90"/>
And further found, that the ſaid Rent of <hi>130 l.</hi> was the full third part of the yearly value of all the Lands and Tenements of the Deviſor. The Queſtion was, If by theſe words of the Deviſe of the Mannor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> the Rent and the Services paſs; <hi>i.e.</hi> the Rent, Homage, and Fealty reſerved upon the Grant made by King <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> of the Mannor and Hundred of <hi>Fremmington;</hi> And if the ſaid Rent and Services are iſſuing out of the Mannor: For if the Rent doth not paſs, then the ſame is deſcended to the Heir of the Marchioneſs; and then being found the full third part of the value, the King is fully anſwered and ſatisfied, and then the reſidue of the Inheritance diſcharged, and is ſettled in the Deviſee. And if the Rent doth not paſs, then is the Heir of the Marchioneſs entituled by the Statute to a third of the whole, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> conceived, That if the Marchioneſs had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by expreſs words the ſaid Rent and Services, they could not paſs; For as to the Services, they are things entire: as Homage and Fealty, they cannot paſs by Deviſe in caſe where Partition is to follow; for ſuch things cannot receive any partition or diviſion, therefore not divideable: For the Statute enables the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to give or deviſe two parts of his Inheritance in three parts to be divided: As <hi>Catalla Felonum</hi> cannot be deviſed, for the reaſon aforeſaid, <hi>Quod fuit Conceſſum per totam Curiam.</hi> But as to the Rent, the Court was clear, That the ſame was deviſeable by the ſaid Statute; and in reſpect of that, the miſchief of many diſtreſſes which the Common Law abhors, is diſpenſed with, and is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſtrainable of common right. And as to the Deviſe, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued much upon the grounds of Deviſes; and put a ground put by <hi>Fineux, 15 H. 7. 12.</hi> Where every Will ought to be conſtrued and taken according as the words purport, or as, it may be, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or implyed by the words, What the intent of the Deviſor was: ſo as we ought to enquire the meaning of the Teſtator out of the words of the Will. And ſee alſo a good Caſe, <hi>19 H 8. 8 &amp; 9.</hi> And he much relyed upon the Caſe of <hi>Bret</hi> and <hi>Rigden, <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 343.</hi> See there the Caſe. So in this Caſe, for as much as ſuch Intent of the Deviſor doth not appear upon the words of the Will, that this Rent ſhall paſs; It ſhall not paſs, for there is not any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Rent, in the whole Will. <hi>Fenner,</hi> argued to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and he argued much upon the favourable Conſtruction which the Law gives to Wills. <hi>14 H. 8.</hi> by Reverſion, for remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp; e contra. 17 E. 3. 8.</hi> A Man may make a Feoffment in Fee of a Mannor, by the name of a Knights Fee, <hi>a multo fortiori,</hi> in the Caſes of Deviſes: And in our Caſe, the Marchioneſs concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That the Rent and Services reſerved out of the Mannor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> was the Mannor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> and that the Law would give ſtrength to that intent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walmeſley</hi> conceived, That the Rent did not paſs by the name of the Mannor, &amp;c. for this Rent <hi>noc in veritate nec in reputatione</hi> was ever taken for a Mannor. Alſo the words, <hi>Of the Mannor of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99485:90"/>
Fremmington</hi> and <hi>Hundred,</hi> are put amongſt others which are Mannors in truth. By which he conceived, That the Deviſor did not intend to paſs but one Mannor, and no other Herediatments, by this Mannor of <hi>Fremmington.</hi> There is a Rule in Law, That in the Conſtruction of a Will, a thing implyed, ſhall not control a thing expreſſed: But here, If by implication the Rent ſhall paſs, then the Mannor of <hi>Camfield</hi> is not paſſed, which was the intent of the Teſtator to paſs, and that by expreſs words. <hi>See 16 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 330. <hi>Clatches</hi> Caſe.</hi> No Implication of any Eſtate in remainder can ſerve when a ſpecial Guift and Limitation is made by the Deviſor himſelf. <hi>See alſo, 16 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 333. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Caſe.</hi> But in our Caſe here, there are not ſufficient words to warrant any Implication; for neither in truth, nor in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reputation was it taken for a Mannor. <hi>27 H. 6. 2. Green-Acre</hi> may paſs by the name of a Mannor, although it be but one Acre of Land, becauſe it is known by the name of a Mannor. <hi>See acc. 22 H. 6. 39.</hi> And ſee, Where before the Statute of <hi>Uſes,</hi> A Man had recoverors to his uſe, and he willeth by his Will, That his Feoffees ſell his Lands; they might ſell. And he ſaid, That if a Man ſeiſed of a Mannor, parcel in Demeſne, and parcel in Service, and he granteth the Demeſnes to one and his Heirs, and afterwards deviſeth his Mannor, peradventure the Services ſhall paſs; but this Rent hath not any reſemblance to a Mannor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gawdy,</hi> This Rent ſhall paſs by the name aforeſaid. Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſtruction is always given in Wills, according to the meaning of the Deviſor, and no part of his Will ſhall be holden void, if by any means it may take effect; Then it here appeareth, that his intent was, That upon theſe words, ſomething ſhould paſs to the Deviſee concerning the Mannor of <hi>Fremmington;</hi> for otherwiſe, the words, <hi>Of the Mannor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi>
                     </hi> are void and frivolous; which ſhall not be in a Will, if any reaſonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction may be made; For it is found expreſly by the Iury, That neither at the time of the Will made, nor at the time of the death of the Teſtator, the Deviſor had any thing in the ſaid Mannor of <hi>Fremmington,</hi> but the ſaid Rent of <hi>130 l. per annum.</hi> And it may well be taken, That the Deviſor being ignorant what thing a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is, thought that this Rent was a Mannor, becauſe that ſhe had Rents and Services out of the ſaid Mannor. For in Conſtruction of a Will, the words ſhall ſerve the intent; And therefore if a Man Deviſeth, That his Lands ſhall be ſold for the payment of his Debts, his Executors ſhall ſell them; for the intent of the Deviſor, names the ſellers ſufficiently. And <hi>See <hi>Plowden,</hi> 20 Eliz. 524. L.</hi> after the Statute of <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> deviſeth, that his Executors ſhall be ſeiſed to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> and his Aſſigns in Fee; whereas then there was no Feoffees to uſe: the ſame was holden a good deviſe of the Land to <hi>A.</hi> But the Iuſtices conceived, That the Deviſor was ignorant of the operation of the Statute in that caſe, and therefore his ignorance was ſupplyed. <hi>See Br. Deviſes, 48. 29 H. 8. A.</hi> had
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99485:91"/>
Feoffees to his uſe; and afterwards after the Statute of <hi>27 H. 8. and 32 H. 8.</hi> he willed, That his Feoffees ſhould make an Eſtate to <hi>B.</hi> and his Heirs; It was holden by <hi>Baldwin, Shelley,</hi> and <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> Iuſtices, That it was a good Deviſe. And ſee, <hi>26 H. 6. <hi>Fitz.</hi> tit. Feoffments &amp; Faits, 12.</hi> A Carue of Land may paſs by the name of a Mannor; therefore <hi>a fortiori</hi> a Rent; for Rents and Services have more affinity, and more reſemble a Mannor, than a Carue of Land. And it cannot be intended, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Teſtator was, to grant the Mannor it ſelf, in which he had not any thing, eſpecially by his Will; for Covin, Colluſion or indirect dealing, cannot be preſumed in a Will. Alſo, The Marchioneſs for <hi>4</hi> years together before her death, had the Rent and Services of the ſaid Mannor; and ſhe well knew, that ſhe her ſelf had not any thing in the ſaid Mannor but the ſaid Rent and Services, and therefore it ſhall be intended, that the ſame was her Mannor of <hi>Fremmington. A.</hi> ſeiſed of a Capital Meſſuage, and great Demeſnes lying to it, Leaſed the ſame for years, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Rent, and afterwards deviſed to another all her Farm in ſuch a place: And it was Ruled in that Caſe, That by that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, the Rent and the Reverſion paſſed. <hi>See the Caſe between <hi>Wrotteſley</hi> and <hi>Adams,</hi> Plow. 19. 1 Eliz. by <hi>Anthony Brown</hi> and <hi>Dyer.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">4 Len. 25.</note>THe Lady <hi>Newman,</hi> Siſter of <hi>James Wingfield</hi> lately deceaſed, Exhibited a Bill of Complaint in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> againſt one <hi>Shyriff</hi> dwelling in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and two others; ſetting forth, That the ſaid <hi>Shyriff</hi> had forged a Deed, purporting, That the ſaid <hi>James</hi> had by the ſame given to him all his goods; and alſo that the ſaid <hi>James</hi> had aſſigned to the ſaid <hi>Shyriff</hi> a Leaſe for years of Lands in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And alſo that the ſaid <hi>Shyriff</hi> had procured the ſaid two other Defendants to depoſe upon their Oath before the Town-Clerk of <hi>London,</hi> That the ſaid Deed was ſealed and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the ſaid <hi>James</hi> as his Deed. It was moved by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Defendant's, That theſe matters of Forgery are not within the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> nor alſo the Perjury, or the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: Whereupon the Lords of the Council referred the Conſideration of the ſaid Statute, to both the Chief Iuſtices, who the next Court-day declared their Opinions upon the ſaid Matters; 1. That the ſaid Statute did not extend to forgery of a Deed conveying a gift of Chattels perſonals: Which ſee by the Statute, which, as to that point, extends but to Obligations, Bills Obligatory, Acquittance, Releaſe, or other diſcharge. And alſo a Deed of an Aſſignment of a Leaſe of Land in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is not within the ſaid Statute. And alſo the ſaid Iuſtices were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That this Perjury, and the procurement of it, is not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the ſaid Statute, becauſe the Oath was taken <hi>Coram non Judice.</hi> For the Town-Clerk of <hi>London</hi> cannot miniſter an Oath in ſuch caſe, no more than a private perſon. But becauſe the Bill in the percloſe and Concluſion of it, was contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, The ſaid Chief Iuſtices were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the ſaid Court might puniſh thoſe offences as misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors at the Common Law, but not according to the Statute. And afterwards <hi>Shyriff</hi> paid for a Fine 3 <hi>l.</hi> and by Order of the Court, was ſet in the Pillory.</p>

And it was moved by <hi>Cook</hi> in arreſt of Iudgment, That here is not any place ſhewed, where theſe Mines were, ſo as <hi>Non conſtat</hi> from what place the <hi>Viſne</hi> ſhall come: As if in an Action (as here) the Plaintiff De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares of a Leaſe made of Land called <hi>R.</hi> in ſuch a County, the ſame is not good, <hi>Cauſa qua ſupra.</hi> The Iſſue here is <hi>Non potuit fodere in praedicta Minera de Greenbourn,</hi> by the ſpace of 7 years

and a half. From whence ſhall the <hi>Viſne</hi> come for the tryal of this? Not from <hi>Durham</hi> where the Leaſe was made, for there is no nearneſs between the place where the Leaſe was made, and this Iſſue: But if the Iſſue had been, That the Leſſor had not any thing in the Mines <hi>tempore dimiſſionis,</hi> it might have been tryed where the Leaſe was made.</p>
                  <p>Another Exception was taken, becauſe the Plea is, <hi>Quod non potuit fodere in 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. dimidio 10 &amp; 11.</hi> and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be <hi>7</hi> years and a half; And the Iury find, <hi>Quod non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit fodere per ſpatium 7 annorum tantum,</hi> without ſpeaking of the half year, and ſo they have not given a full Verdict.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt Exception, It was ſaid by <hi>Cook,</hi> If a thing be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in pleading, which is Iſſuable, and there is not laid down any place of it, although that no Iſſue be joyned upon it; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath prevented the other of his Plea to it, Iudgment given in ſuch caſe ſhall be reverſed: And ſo it was Ruled between <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Stranſham.</hi> So upon the Statute of <hi>Uſury,</hi> the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer charged the Defendant, For that by way of corrupt bargain, he had received ſo much, and did not ſhew the place, although that no Iſſue was joyned upon it, but they were at Iſſue upon another point; yet if Iudgment in ſuch caſe be given, it ſhall be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>And in all <hi>Actions upon the Caſe,</hi> where requeſt is neceſſary, and the Plaintiff ought to alledge it, the place of the Requeſt ought to be ſhewed.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99485:93"/>
for the Record is, <hi>Dimidio anni decimi, &amp; undecimi,</hi> and ſo two half-years, make one whole year, and ſo but <hi>7</hi> years in which the diſturbance is ſuppoſed to be done. <hi>And ſee as to the Viſne <hi>de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Comitatus,</hi> 22 E. 4. 4. <hi>Fitz.

                  </p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Exception</hi> was taken, becauſe the Declaration is, <hi>That the Leaſe was made at <hi>Durham in Comitatu Dunelm.</hi>
                     </hi> and doth not ſay alſo in <hi>Setberg,</hi> for ſuch is the name of the County Palatine. But as to that it was ſaid, Every Writ of Execution which goes into the County Palatine, is directed <hi>Epiſcopo Dunelmenſ. &amp; Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellario ſuo, Quod det in mandatis Vicecom. ſuo, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was called <hi>Setberg</hi> in Ancient time, and the name of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palatine there is commonly called <hi>Dunelm. &amp; Setberg;</hi> and their Pleas there are entred, <hi>Placita coram Juſticiariis <hi>Dunelm.</hi> &amp; <hi>Setberg,</hi>
                     </hi> but the ſame is amongſt themſelves only, and all directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from hence to them are, <hi>Epiſcopo Dunelm.</hi> without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Setberg;</hi> and a Preſident was ſhewed to the Court to ſuch effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manwood,</hi> Levied by Diſtreſs, and ſo nothing arrear, ſhall be tryed where the Leaſe is made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clark,</hi> That is true, For by the <hi>(So)</hi> the Plea before is waived. And ſee <hi>8 H. 5. 10.</hi> Where an Iſſue is to be tryed in <hi>Lincoln, &amp;c.</hi> or ſuch a Town which is a Franchiſe, The <hi>Venire facias</hi> ſhall be of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and not <hi>de Vicineto Lincoln;</hi> for then the Iury ſhould be as well of the County adjoyning, as of <hi>Lincoln</hi> it ſelf; which the <hi>Viſne</hi> of <hi>Lincoln</hi> cannot do: But <hi>Venire facias de Suburbiis</hi> of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> was awarded good.</p>
                  <p>And if in the Caſe at Bar, the Defendant had pleaded, That the Plaintiff had entred into part of the Mines, and ſo ſuſpended his Rent, upon which they are at Iſſue, the ſome by <hi>Manwood,</hi> ſhall be tryed by a Iury <hi>de Corpore Comitatus:</hi> The Iſſue here is, If the Defendant might enjoy theſe Mines <hi>ſecundum veram in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionem dimiſſionis praedict.</hi> and that is referred to the Demiſe which was made at <hi>Durham,</hi> and therefore this Iſſue may be well tryed there. And afterwards at another day, It was holden, That all the Iſſues are <hi>Jeofails.</hi> But as to the want of the place, the ſame was holden a material Exception. <hi>See the Caſe of Mines, <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 337.</hi> Exception was taken to the Information, becauſe it was not laid down there, in what Town or Hamlet <hi>Newlands</hi> lay. And it was holden, The ſame had been a material Exception, if the Defendant had not demurred upon the Information; in which caſe, no Tryal by Iury is to be, &amp;c. And he ſaid, <hi>Miſnoſmer</hi> ſhall be tryed, where the Writ is brought, &amp;c. ſo never admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred as Executors, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manwood,</hi> Here the Leaſe is laid to be made at <hi>Durham</hi> in a place certain. If then there be not any other local thing laid which may draw the Tryal elſewhere, it ſhall be tryed at <hi>Durham</hi> where the Leaſe is made. An Enfant makes a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent, and afterwards re-enters, and avoids his Leaſe by reaſon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99485:94"/>
of his Nonage, and title is found againſt him by that Leaſe, upon which he pleads Nonage, it ſhall be tryed where the Leaſe is made, &amp;c. And afterwards, Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

                     <hi>Wray,</hi> The <hi>Writ of Error</hi> had been the better, if thoſe words, <hi>(ad grave damnum Epiſcopi)</hi> had been left out, for the Biſhop hath loſt nothing.</p>

                     <hi>Wray,</hi> The Biſhop ſhall joyn for Conformity of Law, and for privity of Record; and the Plea of the Biſhop is not ſo ſtrong as a Diſclaymer: For in caſe of a Diſclaimer, the Iudgment is, That the Plaintiff ſhall take nothing by his Writ; but in the caſe of the Biſhop here, the Iudgment is, <hi>Quod querens recuperet prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentationem ſuam verſus dictum Epiſcopum ad Eccleſiam praedictam.

                     <note place="margin">1 Cro. 217.245.</note> 
                     <hi>18 Eliz.</hi> And therefore it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, If an Avowry be within the meaning of the ſaid Statute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anderſon,</hi> Although that the Avowant be <hi>quaſi</hi> an Actor to have a Retorn of the Cattel, if the Diſtreſs be adjudged lawful; yet in truth he is Defendant, and not Plaintiff; And if the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant will juſtifie the taking, and not avow, he is meerly Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: And although that he avow to have a Retorn, yet he cannot be ſaid Plaintiff, no more than the Tenant who voucheth over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to recover in value, may be ſaid Plaintiff. And therefore an Avowry cannot be ſaid a Count, or Declaration, but a Anſwer to the Count, or Declaration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Windham</hi> and <hi>Periam</hi> conceived, That an Avowry is within the Statute; For it comprehends title: And an Anſwer to an Avowry, is ſaid a Bar to an Avowry; and an Avowry is in the place of a Declaration. Admitting, That an Avowry is within the Statute; If the not ſhewing of the Deed be ſuch a defect which may be helped by the Statute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anderſon</hi> conceived, That it was: But the Plaintiff might
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99485:96"/>
have demurred upon the Avowry, for not ſhewing of the Deed, and have had iudgment. But when he hath traverſed the Preſcription as to the point of the diſtreſs, and the ſame is found againſt him, Now it ſhall be intended that the Avowant hath a Deed, although he hath not ſhewed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Windham,</hi> The Title of the Avowant to the Hundred, is the Foundation and ground of the Suit; for if the Avowant hath not a Deed to make him a ſufficient title to the Hundred, he cannot have the Leet: and if no Leet, then no Leet-Fee; and then the Avowant hath no cauſe to diſtrain.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Exception</hi> was taken to the Avowry, becauſe the Avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant hath not ſhewed any Seiſin of the Leet-Fee.</p>
                  <p>And by <hi>Periam,</hi> Such a ſeiſin ought to be ſhewed in ſome perſon certain. For although it needs not always to lay a Seiſin, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by whoſe hands the ſeiſin was had, (for the Inhabitants are charged, and no perſon certain) yet the ſeiſin ought to be laid in a perſon in ſuch ſort as it may be laid: and therefore in this Caſe, foraſmuch as the ſeiſin cannot be ſhewed by the hands of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, it ought to be layed in the Lord. <hi>See 4 H. 6. 29. Br. Avowry, 71.</hi> In a <hi>Recordare</hi> the Defendant avowed, becauſe the King is ſeiſed of the Caſtle of <hi>C. in jure Ducatus ſui Cornub.</hi> to which he had <hi>20 s.</hi> Rent out of the Town of <hi>D. Solvend. annuatim</hi> at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas,</hi> of which Rent, the King and all the Dukes of <hi>Cornwal</hi> aforeſaid had been ſeiſed time out of memory, &amp;c. by the hands of the Inhabitants of the ſame Town, &amp;c. and the ſame was holden a good Avowry. For although that ſeiſin ought to be laid in ſome perſon certain by his hands; yet in that caſe it is good enough; For the ſeiſin by one of the Inhabitants, is the ſeiſin of them all.</p>
                  <p>And in the principal Caſe by <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> It was agreed, That the ſeiſin here was well enough confeſſed; For when the Plaintiff hath taken Iſſue, That they have uſed to diſtrain, all other matters are holden confeſſed, becauſe that the Plaintiff hath not ſaved them to him by proteſtation. Which <hi>Rhodes</hi> granted.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Exception</hi> was taken to the Avowry, becauſe that the Leet by it is ſuppoſed to be holden in <hi>July;</hi> therefore void: which ſee, <hi>Magna Charta, 35.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it was holden by <hi>Anderſon, Windham,</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> That by reaſon of this Preſcription, the Court is well holden in <hi>July,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſaid Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and it might be holden at what day he pleaſed; For his Liberty and Election is not reſtrained by the ſaid Statute, and ſuch is the common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. And note the words of the ſame Statute, <hi>Ita quod quilibet habeat Libertates ſuas quas habuit, vel habere conſuevit, tempore Regis H. avi noſtri, &amp;c. vel quod poſtea perquiſivit, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Rhodes</hi> conceived, That the ſaid Statute is to be intended of Turns only, and not of Leets. Which ſee, <hi>24 H. 8. <hi>Br. Leet,</hi> 23. in the end of the Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by <hi>Periam,</hi> A Leet cannot be holden but according to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99485:97"/>
ſaid Statute, for to that purpoſe was the ſaid Statute made: But if a Leet hath been time out of mind, &amp;c. holden at any other day than that which is limited by the Statute, it is a good preſcription, and it is ſaved by the Statute. The Preſcription is, That he and all. &amp;c. have uſed to hold a Leet once in a year, and hath not ſhewed when the ſaid year begins; for it may be, that a Leet hath been holden there in this year before <hi>July,</hi> and then this is a void Leet, and ſo no Leet-Fee due; and of that Opinion was <hi>Periam, viz.</hi> That the Avowant ought to have ſhewed the beginning and end of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> That he held the ſaid Leet <hi>pro uno anno finito,</hi> ſuch a day: for it may be he hath holden two Leets in one year: But it was ſaid by the other Iuſtices, That that ſhall come on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; for <hi>prima facie</hi> it ſhall be intended that it hath been but once holden in the ſame year, until the contrary be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Note,</hi> by <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> If the King grants to one a Leet to hold <hi>ſemel quolibet anno,</hi> without ſaying, <hi>At the Liberty of the Grantee,</hi> the Grant is good, and the Grantee may hold it at what day he pleaſeth.</p>

                     <hi>Cook,</hi> The ſurviving Child ſhall have the whole, and the Iſſue of <hi>Joan</hi> ſhall have nothing.

                  <p>THe Caſe was;<note place="margin">1 Inſt. 351. a. Hughs Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries 13.</note> A Leaſe was made to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> for their lives, the remainder to <hi>Tho. Venables</hi> in tail; who <hi>3 Eliz.</hi> was attainted of Felony: <hi>23 Eliz.</hi> there was a General Pardon. <hi>Tho. Venables, 24 Eliz.</hi> levied a Fine, and ſuffered a Recovery to the uſe of <hi>Harris,</hi> Serjeant: Office is found, <hi>Harris</hi> traverſed the Office; and thereupon was a Demurrer: It was argued by <hi>Leake,</hi> That Traverſe did not lie in this Caſe; <hi>4 H. 7. 7</hi> Where the King is entituled by double matter of Record, the party ſhall not be admitted to his Traverſe, nor to his <hi>Monſtrans de Droit,</hi> but is put to his Petition. Which ſee, <hi>3 E. 4. 23.</hi> in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> Where Tenant of the King is At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of Treaſon, and the ſame is found by Office. See alſo <hi>11 H. 4.</hi> in the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> And the ſame is not helped by the Statute of <hi>2 E. 6. Cap. 8.</hi> for the words are, <hi>Untruly found by Office,</hi> but here the Office is true: By this Attainder, <hi>Tho. Venables</hi> is utterly diſabled to do any Act; For by <hi>Bracton,</hi> a Perſon attainted <hi>forisfacit Patriam, Regnum, &amp; Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem ſuam, 13 E. 4.</hi> One was attainted of Felony: And before Office found, the King granted over his Lands. Alſo he is not helped by the General Pardon; For before the General Pardon, he had a ſpecial Pardon; therefore the General Pardon <hi>nihil ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur</hi> as to him: But by the Iuſtices, the forfeiture doth remain until the General Pardon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harris,</hi> to the contrary. And he put the Caſe of Sir <hi>James Ormond, 4 H. 7. 7.</hi> Where the King is entituled by matter of Record, and the ſubject confeſſeth the title of the King, and avoids it by as high matter as that is for the King, Traverſe in that caſe lieth: and if the King be entituled by double matter of Record, if the party avoids one of the ſaid Records by another Record, he ſhall be admitted to his Traverſe; And ſo here we have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which is a Record, and that ſhall avoid the Record for the King: And here the Pardon hath purged the forfeiture in reſpect of the Offence. And he ſaid, That Tenant in tail being attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Felony, ſhall not loſe his Lands, but the profits only, for he hath his Intereſt by the Will of the Donor, and it is a Confidence repoſed in him; and as <hi>Walſingham's</hi> Caſe is he cannot grant over his Eſtate. And ſee, in <hi>Wroth's</hi> Caſe, Annuity granted <hi>pro Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilio impendendo,</hi> cannot be granted over, or forfeited, for there is a Confidence. <hi>See <hi>Empſon</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Dyer,</hi> 2. and, 29 Aſſ. 60.</hi> If the Iſſue in tail be <hi>Outlawed</hi> of Felony in the life of his Father, and gets his Pardon in the life of his Father, after the death of his Father he may enter. But by <hi>Thorp,</hi> If the Iſſue in tail gets his Pardon after the death of his Father, then the King ſhall have the profits of the Lands during the life of the Iſſue. And the Caſe of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99485:100"/>
Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> was debated in the Parliament, <hi>27 Eliz.</hi> That he being Dean of <hi>Exeter,</hi> was ſeiſed of Lands in the right of his Church, and was attainted of Treaſon. It was holden, he ſhould forfeit the profits of ſuch Lands. But admit, That by this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, the Land be forfeited; yet the party hath the Freehold until Office found. <hi>See <hi>Nicholls</hi> Caſe, <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> And alſo the Caſe of the Dutchy, in <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> acc.</hi> And here, the Pardon hath diſpenſed with the forfeiture. A Tenant of the King aliens in <hi>Mortmain</hi> before Office found, the King pardons it, it is good. The Lord <hi>Poynings</hi> conveyed all his Lands to Sir <hi>Adrian Poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> who was an Alien, and after made a Denizen, and the King pardoned and releaſed to him all his right in the ſaid Lands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any words of grant; and adjudged, the ſame did bind the King: And he ſaid, he had a good preſident, <hi>14 H. 7.</hi> Where a General Pardon before ſeiſure into the hands of the King, was allowed good; contrary, after a ſeiſure without words of Grant. <hi>See Br. 29 H. 8. <hi>Br. Charter of Pardon,</hi> 52.</hi> If a Man be attainted of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and the King pardons him all Felonies <hi>&amp; executiones eorun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> and <hi>Outlawries, &amp;c.</hi> and releaſes all forfeitures of Lands and Tenements, and of Goods and Chattels, the ſame will not ſerve but for life of Lands, if no Office be found, but it will not ſerve for the goods without words of reſtitution and grant; for the King is entituled to them by the Outlawry without office: But the King is not entituled to Land, until Office be found. <hi>See <hi>Ibid.</hi> 33 H. 8. 71.</hi> The Heir intrudes, and before Office found, the King pardons, now the Heir is diſcharged as well of the Iſſues and profits, as of the Intruſion it ſelf. But a Pardon given after the Office found, is available for the Offence, but not for the Iſſues and profits. And he cited the Caſe of <hi>Cole</hi> in <hi>Plowden,</hi> where a Pardon was granted, mean between the ſtroak and the death. <hi>See 35 H. 6. 1. 16 E. 4. 1. 8 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 249. <hi>Brereton</hi>'s Caſe. 11 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 284, 285.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egerton,</hi> Sollicitor, contrary, This Traverſe is not good, for he who traverſeth, hath not made title to himſelf as he ought, upon which the Queen may take Iſſue; for it is in the Election of the Queen to maintain her own title, or to traverſe the title of the party. At the Common Law, no Traverſe lay but where Livery might be ſued; but that is helped by the Statute of <hi>34 E. 3.</hi> but where the King is entituled by double matter of Record (as in our Caſe he is) no Traverſe was allowed until <hi>2 E. 6. Cap. 8.</hi> And in ſuch Caſe, two things are requiſite, <hi>1.</hi> That the Office be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly found. <hi>2.</hi> That the party who is to be admitted to his Traverſe, have juſt title or Intereſt of Eſtate of Freehold, &amp;c. But in our Caſe, the Office is confeſſed by the Traverſe to be true, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the conveyance be not truly found. And alſo <hi>Harris,</hi> at the time of the Office found, had not juſt title, but his Intereſt came to him, long time after the Office found. Alſo the traverſe is not good, for he traverſeth the matter of the Conveyance, which is not traverſable; For if the Queen hath title, <hi>non refert, quo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99485:100"/>
modo,</hi> or by what Conveyance ſhe hath it. As to the matter in Law, Tenant in tail in remainder is Attainted of Felony, If the King during the life of the Tenant in tail, ſhall have the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. And he conceived, ſhe ſhould; For it ſhall not be in abey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and it cannot be in any other; for when he is attainted, he is dead as unto the King: The chief Lord cannot have it; For the Tenant for life is alive; and alſo he in the remainder in Fee; &amp;c. The Donor ſhall not have it, for the Tenant is not naturally dead, but civilly; and the Land cannot revert before the Tenant in tail be naturally dead without Iſſue. But if there were any other in whom the Freehold could veſt, then the King ſhould not have the Freehold, but only the profits. So if the Tenant be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, the Lord ſhall have the Land preſently, <hi>3 E. 3. 4 E. 3.</hi> The Husband ſeiſed in the right of his Wife, is attainted of Felony, the King ſhall have but the profits, becauſe that the Freehold reſts in the Wife; and if the Lord entreth, the Wife ſhall have an Aſſiſe. And Tenant in tail may forfeit for his life, as he may grant during his life. <hi>See Old N.B. 99.</hi> If Tenant in tail for Life, Dower, or by the Curteſie, be attaint of Felony, the King ſhall have the Land during their lives; and after their deceaſe, he in the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall ſue to the King by Petition, and ſhall have the Lands out of the Kings hands: And there it is further ſaid, That the Lord by Eſcheat cannot have it; for the party attainted was not his very Tenant, but he in the Reverſion; for the term yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures: But now is to ſee, If the Freehold be in the King without Office; And I conceive that it is, Where the King is entituled to an Action, there the King ought to have an Office, and a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon it: As where the King is entituled to a <hi>Ceſſavit,</hi> Action of Waſte, &amp;c. <hi>14 H. 7. 12.</hi> Where entry in the Caſe of a Common perſon is neceſſary, there behoves to be an Office for the King. As where the Kings Villain purchaſeth Lands, or an Alien born, &amp;c. ſo is it, for a Condition broken, <hi>Mortmain, &amp;c.</hi> In ſome Caſes an Office is only neceſſary to inſtruct the King how he ſhall charge the Officer for the profits, which may be ſupplyed as well by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey as by Office: As if the King be to take by deſcent, or as the Caſe is here. And it is true, That a perſon attainted of Felony, may during his Attainder purchaſe Lands, and yet he cannot keep it againſt the King. And it is clear, That by the Common Law in ſuch Caſes, the Land was in the King, but not to grant. For the Statute of <hi>18 H. 6.</hi> was an Impediment to that; But now that defect is ſupplyed by the Statute of <hi>33 H. 8.</hi> So as now the King may grant without Office. <hi>See 26 Eliz. <hi>Cook</hi> 3 Part, <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>'s Caſe.</hi> And in our Caſe, Office is not neceſſary to entitle the King, but to explain his Title. <hi>See 9 H 7. 2.</hi> The Lands of a Man attainted of High Treaſon, are in the King without Office; ſo where the Kings Tenant dieth without Heir; or Tenant in tail of the gift of the King dieth without Iſſue. <hi>See <hi>Br.</hi> Office before the Eſcheator, 34. See 13 H. 4. 278.</hi> A Man Attainted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99485:101"/>
the King before Office, grants his Lands and Goods; Things which lie in Grant, as Advowſons, Rents, &amp;c. ſuch things upon Attainder are in the King without Office. As to the General Pardon of <hi>23 Eliz.</hi> He conceived, That the ſame did not extend to this Caſe, and that this Intereſt of the Queen by this Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der did not paſs by the Pardon out of the Queen; So if the Queen had but a Right and title only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> Attorny General, By this Attainder, the Eſtate of him in the Remainder in tail accrued to the Queen for the life of him in the Remainder: For by our Law, Felony is puniſhed by the death of the Offendor, and the loſs of his Goods and Lands for the example of others, therefore nothing is left in him. Tenant for life is attainted of Felony, The King pardons to him his life, yet he ſhall have his Lands during his life; for he himſelf cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them for his life: And ſo it is of Tenant in tail, &amp;c. for he may forfeit all that which he hath, and that is an Eſtate for his life which is the Freehold. If Lands be given to one and his Heirs for the life of another, and the Donee be attainted of Felony, the King ſhall have the Land during the life of <hi>Ceſtuy que vie,</hi> for the Heir cannot have it, becauſe the blood is corrupt, and there is not any Occupancy in the Caſe: For <hi>17 E. 3.</hi> the Iuſtices would not accept a Fine of Lands for the life of another, becauſe an Occupant might be in the Caſe; But for a Fine of Lands to one and his He is for the life of another, they accepted a Fine, for there is no miſchief of Occupancy. Land is given to <hi>A.</hi> for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>A.</hi> who is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of Felony: <hi>A.</hi> dieth; now the King hath a Fee executed: And here in our Caſe, If this Tenant for life had been dead, no <hi>Praecipe</hi> would lie againſt him in the remainder being in poſſeſſion, but the party who had right was to ſue to the King by Petition. <hi>4 E. 3.</hi> If one ſeiſed in the right of his Wife of Lands for life, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, the King ſhall have <hi>exitus &amp; proficua:</hi> But I conceive that Caſe is not Law: For ſee <hi>F.N.B. 254. D.</hi> The Husband ſeiſed in the right of his Wife in Fee, is Outlawed of Felony; the King ſeiſeth, the Husband dieth; Now ſhall iſſue forth a <hi>Diem Clauſit extremum;</hi> the words of which Writ are in ſuch caſe, <hi>Quia A. cujus terra &amp; Tenement. quae ipſe tenuit de jure &amp; haereditate N. uxoris ſuae, adhuc ſuperſtites occaſione cujuſdam utlagariae in ipſum pro quadam felonia inde indictatus fuit, &amp;c. in manu Domini H. Patris noſtri extiterunt, &amp;c.</hi> therefore, the King hath not <hi>exitus tantum,</hi> but alſo the Land it ſelf. <hi>See to the ſame purpoſe, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, 292. b. And ſee alſo now in the Book of Pleas of the Crown, 186, 187.</hi> which affirmeth, That Tenant in tail being attainted of Felony, ſhall forfeit the Land during his life. And he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That this Eſtate of <hi>Tho. Venables</hi> was in the King without Office; not to grant, for he is reſtrained by the Statute of <hi>18 H. 8.</hi> but it is in him ſo before Office, that he who hath right ought to ſue to the King by Petition, if he will have the ſame; Yet he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99485:101"/>
That before the ſaid Statute of <hi>18 H. 6.</hi> the King might grant it before Office; as it appeareth by <hi>Thirning, 13 H. 4. 278.</hi> which was before the Statute. So if the Kings Tenant makes a Leaſe for years, the remainder over to another in Fee, who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without Heir, the ſaid remainder is in the King without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, becauſe a common perſon in ſuch caſe cannot enter, but a Claim is ſufficient; and therefore it ſhall be in the King without Office. As to the Pardon, He conceived, That it did not extend to this Eſtate; For the ſame is a Freehold, therefore not within the Pardon: As if the Kings Tenant be attainted of Felony, and the King pardons him all Offences, and all which he may pardon; theſe words will not go, or extend to Freehold, but only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal matters, and ſuch puniſhments and pains which do concern Chattels. But it may be Objected, That in this Pardon, title of <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and <hi>Re-entries for Conditions</hi> are excepted; and therefore if they had not been excepted, they had been releaſed by the Pardon; And therefore this Pardon doth extend to Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Freeholds. As to that, I ſay, That ſuch Exceptions were not in uſe in the time of King <hi>Ed. 4.</hi> and ſuch Inheritances and Freeholds were not taken to be within ſuch Pardons; And ſuch Exceptions began <hi>5 Eliz.</hi> And he ſaid, he had been of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in ſuch Caſes, where it had been taken, That ſuch Pardons did not extend to Freeholds. As, an Abbot was diſſeiſed, and during the Diſſeiſin, the Abby was diſſolved; the King made ſuch a Pardon, the ſame did not transfer the Kings right. And in this Caſe, there are divers Exceptions of Goods and Chattels in many caſes, and therefore it cannot be intended that this Pardon doth extend to Freeholds. And ſee the ſaid Act of Pardon; There, the Queen gave and granted all Goods, Chattels, Debts, Fines, Iſſues, Profits, Amercements, Forfeitures, and Sums of Mony; which word <hi>(Forfeiture)</hi> ſhall be intended perſonal forfeiture, and not otherwiſe, for it is coupled with things of ſuch nature. And as to the Traverſe, he conceived, That it did not lie in this Caſe; For the Office is not untrue in ſubſtance, although it be void in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: And alſo the King here is entituled by double mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Record; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Attainder and the Office. And he ſaid, That the Statutes of <hi>34 &amp; 36 E. 3.</hi> which gave Traverſe, are to be meant of Offices found <hi>virtute Officii,</hi> and not <hi>virtute Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis;</hi> for then Eſcheators were very troubleſome. And <hi>2 E. 6.</hi> doth not give traverſe, but where the Office is untruly found. As if the Kings Tenant be diſſeiſed, and the Diſſeiſor be Attainted; The Queen ſeiſeth the Land; Now the Diſſeiſee hath no remedy by traverſe upon the Statute of <hi>2 E. 6.</hi> but is put to his <hi>Monſtrans de Droit,</hi> for that the Office is true: But if I be the Kings Tenant, and ſeiſed of Lands accordingly; and it is found that <hi>J.S.</hi> was ſeiſed of my Land, and attainted, &amp;c. whereas in truth, he had not any thing in my Land, there Traverſe lieth; For the Office is falſe; And ſo our Caſe for the Traverſe, is at the Common Law. And it is true, that <hi>Venables</hi> was ſeiſed, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Cook,</hi> to the contrary; And he conceived, That by the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Queen had gained but a Chattel; And that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Forfeiture, If <hi>Venables</hi> had been in poſſeſſion, a <hi>Praecipe</hi> ſhould be brought againſt him. And whereas it hath been ſaid by Mr. Attorny, That the Writs ſet down in the Regiſter, are the beſt Expoſitors of our Law; the ſame is not ſo: For the Regiſter ſaith, That Waſte lieth notwithſtanding a mean Remainder, which is not now Law, but it hath been clearly ruled to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>See acc. 50 E. 3.</hi> The Regiſter therefore, and the Writs, are ſubject to the Iudgments of our Law. And the Writ of <hi>Diem clauſit extremum,</hi> is not to the contrary: For I confeſs, that in ſuch caſe,<note place="margin">Hob. Rep. 342.</note> the Land ſhall be ſeiſed into the Kings hands, but the King ſhall have but a Chattel in it. It hath been argued, He may grant, therefore he may forfeit. <hi>Nego Conſequentiam;</hi> For a Man, ſeiſed in the right of his Wife, may grant, but not forfeit. Gardian in Socage may grant, but not forfeit; The Husband may grant a Term for years which he hath in the right of his Wife, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forfeit it. A Woman enheritrix taketh Husband, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is attainted of Felony, the King pardons him, they have Iſſue; the Woman dieth, the Husband ſhall be Tenant by the Curteſie, which proveth, that the King hath no Freehold by this Attainder. Before the Statute of <hi>Weſt. 2.</hi> Tenant in tail <hi>poſt prolem ſuſcitatam</hi> might forfeit the Land, but now the Statute hath ſo incorporated the Eſtate tail to the Tenant in tail, that it cannot be deveſted: yea, a Fine levied <hi>ipſo jure eſt nullus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as to the poſſeſſion it be a diſcontinuance: And that is the reaſon, wherefore Tenant in tail ſhall not be ſeiſed to another's uſe. <hi>See <hi>Stamford,</hi> 190. b.</hi> The Husband ſeiſed in the right of his Wife, is attainted of Felony, the King ſhall have the Iſſues of the Land of the Wife during the life of the Husband, &amp;c. So if Tenant in tail be Attainted of Felony, that is but a Chattel in the Lands of the Wife, and alſo in the Lands of the Tenant in tail; and if the poſſeſſions of a Biſhop be ſeiſed into the Kings hands for a Contempt, In ſuch caſe the King hath poſſeſſion, and not only the profits: The ſame Law of Lands of Tenant in tail or for life, being attainted of Felony. So ſeiſure for alienation without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or of the poſſeſſions of Poor Aliens. <hi>See <hi>Br.</hi> Reſeiſure, 10.</hi> So where the ſeiſure is for Idiocy. And he conceived, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is in the King without Office. And as to the Caſe of <hi>13 H. 4. 6.</hi> I confeſs it; For all that time many, and amongſt them Lawyers and Iuſtices, were attainted by Parliament; And ſo was Sir <hi>John Salisbury,</hi> whoſe Caſe it was, and their Lands by Act of Parliament given expreſly to the King; and therefore I grant, that their Lands were in the King without Office. Tenant in Fee of a Common Lord is attainted of Felony, his Lands remain in him during his life, till the entry of the Lord; and where the King is Lord, until Office be found: but in the caſe of a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, after the death of the perſon attainted, it is in the Lord before
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99485:102"/>
Entry; and in the Caſe of the King, before Office, for the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Abeyance. <hi>And ſee the Lord <hi>Lovell</hi>'s Caſe, 18 Eliz. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 485, 486.</hi> Where it is holden, That upon Attainder of Treaſon by Act of Parliament, the Lands were not in the King without Office in the life of the perſon attainted, upon the words of the Act, <hi>ſhall forfeit. See <hi>Stamford,</hi> 54, 55. acc. 3.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, That this Intereſt which came to the King by this Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was but a Chattel, and then it is releaſed by the Pardon; And ſo he conceived, If it be a Freehold. For the words of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon are large and liberal; <hi>Pardon and Releaſe all manner of Treaſons, &amp;c. And all other things, cauſes, &amp;c.</hi> and here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures are pardoned; And alſo this word <hi>(Things)</hi> is a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, &amp;c. And although it be a general word, yet by the direction of the General Pardon it ought to be beneficially expounded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as if all things had been eſpecially ſet down. Alſo the words are, <hi>Pardon them and their Heirs;</hi> therefore the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Inheritances for any Offence not excepted, for there is the word <hi>Heirs;</hi> And the third branch doth concern only Chattels, and that is by the word <hi>Grant;</hi> where the former is, by the words, <hi>Releaſe and Acquit. See <hi>Br. Charter of Pardon,</hi> 71. 33 H. 8.</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the King dieth ſeiſed, the Heir intrudes, Office is found; in that caſe by Pardons of all Intruſions, the Offence is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not the Iſſues and Profits. But by the Pardon aforeſaid, all is pardoned. And here in our Caſe, the Office is void; For the Statute makes all Precepts, Conditions, void, &amp;c. being award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſuch Forfeitures. See alſo in the ſecond Branch, <hi>Vexed and inquieted in Body, Good, Lands, &amp;c.</hi> And ſee alſo amongſt the Exceptions, That perſons ſtanding endicted of wilful Murder, and forfeiture of Goods, Lands, Tenements, grown by any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed by ſuch perſon; By which he conceived, That if that Exception had not been, the Land of ſuch a perſon, if he had been attainted upon ſuch Indictment, ſhould be forfeited. As to the Traverſe, he conceived, That in as much as the Office is true, our plea is a <hi>Monſtrans de Droit,</hi> although it concludes with a Traverſe. We vary from the Office in number of perſons, and in the day of the Feoffment; and every Circumſtance in the Kings Caſe is to be traverſed, and our plea in ſubſtance doth confeſs and avoid the Office.</p>
                  <p>Although the King here be entituled by double matter of Record; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Attainder and the Office; yet one of the ſaid Records is diſcharged by another Record; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Pardon, and then there is but one Record remaining; <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Office, and therefore our Traverſe doth lie. And he conceived, That at the Common Law there was a Traverſe; as where it was found by Office, That the Leſſee of the King had done Waſte, or ceſſed for two years; and there it is ſaid, That the Leſſee and Tenant in an Action brought againſt them, may traverſe the Office, Therefore traverſe was at the Common Law, where the King was entituled
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99485:103"/>
by ſingle matter of Record. So upon an Office finding an Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Licence, Traverſe was by the Common Law. See Traverſe in ſuch Caſe, in the Caſe of <hi>William de Herlington, 43 Aſſ. 28. See <hi>Br.</hi> Traverſe, 54.</hi> Petition is by the Common Law, and Traverſe by the Statute; <hi>Frowick</hi> in his Reading. <hi>See <hi>Stamf.</hi> Prerogat. 60.</hi> That Traverſe in the Caſe of Goods was at the Common Law, but Traverſe for Lands found by Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by <hi>34 E. 3. Cap. 14.</hi> therefore the remedy was by Petition. See now, <hi>Cook 4. Part,</hi> the <hi>Sadler's Caſe, 55, 56.</hi> Traverſe was at the Common Law concerning Freehold and Inheritance, but that was in ſpecial Caſes, when by the Office the Land is not in the Kings hands, nor the King by that is in poſſeſſion, but only by the Office, and entituled to the Action, and cannot make ſeiſure without ſuit there: in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> brought by the King in the nature of ſuch an Action to which he is entituled, the party may appear unto the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and traverſe the Office by the Common-Law.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99485:106"/>
they are to be charged as Adminiſtrators only, and not otherwiſe. <hi>See 50 E. 3. 9. 20 H. 6. 1.</hi> And ſee the Caſe of the Cardinal of <hi>Canterbury, 9 E. 4. 33.</hi> If one Adminiſtreth of his own wrong, and afterwards takes Letters of Adminiſtration, he ſhall be ſued not as Executor, but as Adminiſtrator. <hi>See 21 H. 6. 8.</hi>

But it was agreed on all ſides, That if this Action had been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpecially, it had been clearly good. And it was Obſerved, That in the principal Caſe the Accomptant was dead before the Grant; ſo that his Executors were chargeable to the Queen, to render an Accompt, and the Queen was entituled to it. It hath been Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That this Action of Accompt came to the King by reaſon of his Prerogative Royal, and in vertue thereof the Executors are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable to her, and therefore the Queen cannot grant the ſame over to a Subject: Certainly the ſame is not an Incident inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Crown, nor a Flower of the Crown; as the King cannot grant over to a Subject power to pardon Felons, for that is proper and peculiar to the perſon of the King; nor that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may have a Court of Chancery: And although this matter of Accompt is at the firſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> at the time of the Grant, uncertain; yet by matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> it may be reduced to certainty, <hi>i.e.</hi> by the Accompt; and although the Accompt be not expreſly named in the Letters Patents, yet the words of the Grant, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> do amount to as much. And <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Iuſtice, conceived, That this Accompt ought to be brought in the name of the Queen: And all the Iuſtices were of Opinion, That if the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> had been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the time of the ſaid Grant of the Queen, the Grant had not been good; for then the Action againſt the Executors, which is the matter of Prerogative, had not been veſted in the Queen.</p>

did demur in Law. It was argued by <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Serjeant, for the Biſhop, but to little purpoſe, therefore I will report but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſages of his Argument: He conceived, That that general Pleading of <hi>Schiſmaticus inveteratus</hi> was good enough; as, if the Biſhop certifieth Baſtardy, It is ſufficient to ſay, <hi>Baſtardus, ſive Spurius,</hi> without other Circumſtances, as to ſay, On the body of ſuch a Woman begotten: <hi>Lollard derivatur à Lollio. i. e. Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> Tares. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was Dean of <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was convented before the Ordinary for Schiſm, becauſe he would not uſe a Surplice; and for that he was condemned for a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and deprived of his Deanery, in the time of the Queen that now is. <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> Serjeant, for the Plaintiffs, That the Biſhop in his Plea ought to have ſhewed ſpecially, how and in what point the Preſentee of the Plaintiffs was <hi>Schiſmaticus:</hi> There are divers manners of Schiſms. <hi>1.</hi> In Doctrine. <hi>2.</hi> In man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and of each kind there are many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore, for doubt of enveigling the Metropolitan, who is to try that Iſſue, the Defendant ought to have ſhewed the Schiſm in certain, in which the Metropolitan was to examine the Clerk readily. <hi>See 38 E. 3. 2.</hi> the Caſe of the Counteſs of <hi>Arundel,</hi> where in a <hi>Quare Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit</hi> the Ordinary pleaded, That the Preſentee was <hi>Criminoſus &amp; Perjurus,</hi> and ſhewed the Cauſe in what and when he was Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. And although this Iſſue is to be tryed by the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, yet it ought to be formally pleaded in the Temporal Court, and with certainty: As where a Divorce is pleaded, It is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſay, That a Divorce was had; but the party ought to ſhew for what cauſe, and before what Iudge the Divorce was had, which ſee <hi>18 E. 4. 29.</hi> where the Divorce is ſpecially pleaded for cauſe of Conſanguinity; for by one Divorce the Iſſues are baſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized, by others not. See as to the Pleading of a Divorce <hi>11 H. 7. 9.</hi> Profeſſion, although it be a Spiritual thing, yet the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pleading of it, is not good; but he who pleads it, ought to ſhew, of what Order, and under whoſe Obedience, <hi>40 E. 3. 37.</hi> which ſee the Book of Entries <hi>444.

If upon the Statute of <hi>27 Eliz.</hi> this defect be helped; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was not, for here the defect is in matter, and not in form: As if, in Treſpaſs of his Cloſe breaking, the Defendant juſtifies by a Leaſe for years, and doth not ſhew the place where the Leaſe was made, and the Plaintiff demurrs generally upon it; the ſaid defect is not helped by the ſaid Statute, for that it is Matter. So in a Formedon in Diſcender, The Defendant pleads a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty with Aſſets, without ſhewing the place where the Aſſets is, and the Demandant demurrs upon it generally, the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is not helped by the ſaid Statute: See a good Caſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged upon the Statute, <hi>Mich. 28 &amp; 29 Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Henly</hi> and <hi>Broad.

Alſo the Conſtable cannot appoint any to watch at his pleaſure, but only in his turn, for otherwiſe the Conſtable might upon a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge vex his Neighbors. <hi>See</hi> 22 <hi>E</hi> 4. 35. <hi>Wray,</hi> Chief, Iuſtice, The <hi>Defendant</hi> ought to ſhew, That the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> was

                  <p>THe Caſe was, <hi>George Robinſon</hi> Leſſee for years of the Mannor of <hi>Drayton-Baſſet,</hi> the Reverſion to the King, deviſed his Term to his Wife, as long as ſhe ſhould keep her ſelf a Widow, the remainder over, if ſhe married; and died, and made his Wife and <hi>William</hi> his Son his Executors, the ſaid <hi>William</hi> being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age; And therefore Adminiſtration was committed to the Wife alone, and ſhe only proved the Will: And afterwards the Wife granted all her Intereſt to the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> and died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cook,</hi> Nothing paſſeth by the Grant, for <hi>William</hi> had the Term before; for every Executor hath an entire Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Popham,</hi> Contrary; for at the time of that Grant, the Son was within age, and had not adminiſtred, nor proved the Will; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in effect the Wife was ſole Executrix.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egerton,</hi> Sollicitor, If during the ſole Executorſhip of the Wife, one committeth a Treſpaſs upon the Land, the Wife alone ſhall have the Action of Treſpaſs without naming her Co-executor: Which <hi>Cook</hi> denyed. And he cited the Caſe, 16 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 4. If two Executors be, and one of them only is poſſeſſed of the Goods of the Teſtator, and a ſtranger takes them out of his poſſeſſion, to whom the other Executor doth releaſe; and afterwards the Executor out of whoſe poſſeſſion the Goods were taken, brings an Action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt the Treſpaſſor, who pleads the Releaſe of the other Executor; It was holden a good Plea; for the poſſeſſion of the one, was the poſſeſſion of the other. The Caſe was further, That <hi>Tho. Robinſon</hi> the Defendant in pleading had ſhewed, That <hi>George Robinſon</hi> was poſſeſſed, and deviſed the ſame to his Wife, who grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame to <hi>William,</hi> who deviſed the ſame to the Defendant. On the other ſide, it was ſhewed, That <hi>Tho. Robinſon</hi> the Defendant granted the ſaid Term to <hi>Paramour</hi> the Plaintiff; upon which they were at Iſſue. And the Queſtion now was, If <hi>Tho.</hi> againſt his own pleading might give in Evidence, That <hi>Thomas</hi> did not grant; For if the gift by the Wife to <hi>William</hi> was void, and he had the Term as Executor, Then he could not Deviſe it. And it was ſhewed alſo, That <hi>Thomas</hi> granted it by Indenture to <hi>Paramour:</hi> And now, If againſt that Indenture, he might give in Evidence ſuch ſpecial matter, was the doubt. And, If the party ſhall be concluded if the Iury ſhall be concluded <hi>ad dicendum veritatem?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Egerton,</hi> As well the Iurors as the parties are concluded by the confeſſion of the parties in the Record. For here, <hi>Thomas</hi> confeſſeth, That <hi>William</hi> deviſed to him; <hi>virtute cujus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Co. 4.</note> he was poſſeſſed.</p>

                  <p>But the Opinion of <hi>Manwood,</hi> Chief Baron, was, That if the parties do admit a thing <hi>per nient dedire,</hi> the Iury is not bound by it; but where, upon the pleading a ſpecial matter is confeſſed, there the Iury ſhall be bound by it.

                  <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> It was holden by Special Verdict,<note place="margin">1 Cro. 122.</note> That <hi>W.

But the Serjeants at the Bar argued, That there was a difference between the Caſe cited, and the Caſe at Bar: For in the Caſe cited, the Fine was pleaded in Bar; but here it was not pleaded, but found by Special Verdict. To which it was ſaid by the Court, That the ſame is not any difference; For the Fine by the Statute is not any matter of Eſtoppel or Concluſion, but by the Statute binds and extincts the entail, and the right of it. And Fines are as ſufficient to bind the right of the entail when they are found by Special Verdict, as when they are pleaded in Bar.</p>

                  <p>THE Caſe of <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi> in a Replevin,<note place="margin">1 Cro. 73. 2 Len. 128. 4 Len. 70.</note> the which ſee <hi>Mich.</hi> 29 <hi>Eliz. Leon.</hi> 2 <hi>Part,</hi> 129. was argued again by <hi>Egerton,</hi> Sollicitor General; And he ſaid, In ſome Caſe, This word <hi>(Proviſo)</hi> is not a Condition, but only an Explanation of the Sentence precedent: If it be in the Negative, and makes reſtraint of the Common Law, then it is a Condition: As a Leaſe for years, Proviſo, That he ſhall not alien, or do Waſte. And if the Proviſo be in the Affirmative, and by that the party be bound to do a thing, which of common Right he is not bound to do, it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. A Leaſe for years, or for life, Proviſo, That he ſhall pay ſuch a ſum. Leſſee for years, Proviſo, That the Leſſee ſhall pay his Rent generally, without limitation of any day; it is on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And he held by way of Argument in the principal Caſe, That <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhould take adgantage of conditions, which are knit to Eſtates, as for payment of Rent, but not concerning col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral things; And ſuch expoſition of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath been made there before. And admit it be a Condition, Yet the Leſſor cannot re-enter, for the Rent was not well demanded; For 20 <hi>l.</hi> Rent is reſerved yearly, payable at four Feaſts, and here the Leſſor hath demanded 10 <hi>l. ſcil.</hi> The Rent of two ſeveral Quarters, whereas only Rent was demandable in point of the Condition. <hi>Cook</hi> conceived, That it was a Condition; but every Proviſo did not make a Condition: The Leſſor Covenants, That the Leſſee ſhall take ſufficient Wood, Proviſo, that he ſhall not take great Timber; that Proviſo doth not make the Covenant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, but only explains the ſame: A Leaſe without Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Waſte, Proviſo, that the Leſſee ſhall not do voluntary Waſte, is not any Proviſo, but a reſtraint of the Liberty given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and doth but qualifie the Liberty: As <hi>Littletons</hi> Caſe, Grant of a Rent-Charge, Proviſo, that it ſhall not extend to charge the perſon of the Grantor, that Proviſo doth not make the Grant Conditional, ſo that, if the Grantee bring a Writ of Annuity againſt the Grantor, the Grant be determined, &amp;c. A Leaſe for years, Proviſo, that if the Leſſee ſhall be diſpoſed to Alien, that the Leſſor ſhall have the firſt offer, &amp;c. The ſame is not a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſee by <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> and <hi>Baldwin,</hi> 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 13. A Leaſe for years upon Condition, That if the Leſſee will hold over his Term, That then he ſhall pay ſo much Rent, the ſame is not Condition, for it is at the pleaſure of the Leſſee, &amp;c. and it is not compulſory. A Feoffment in Fee with warranty, Proviſo, that the Feoffee ſhall not vouch; the ſame doth not make the warranty Conditional, but only abridgeth the warranty. Sir <hi>Richard Peckſall</hi> leaſed certain Lands for years, and Covenanted, That
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99485:120"/>
the Leſſee ſhould take at his pleaſure the Trees there growing; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, That he ſhould not take Trees of ſuch a bigneſs: It was holden in that Caſe to be no Condition. So in the Covenant for further aſſurance, Proviſo, That the Bargainor ſhall not be compelled to travail for the making of the aſſurance above ten miles, &amp;c. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that it be a Condition, yet the Leſſor upon the matter cannot take advantage of it; For he hath not demeaned himſelf in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Rent as he ought. For he hath demanded Rents due to him at ſeveral Quarters; and that he cannot demand in point of forfeiture, for then the Leſſor may leave his Rent in the Hands of the Leſſee until it amount to a great ſum of 200 or 300 <hi>l.</hi> and then upon a ſudden demand of the Rent, when the Leſſee is not ſo well furniſhed, nor can be at ſo ſhort warning, to pay the ſame. And it may be likened to the Caſe in 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>A.</hi> granteth to <hi>B.</hi> ten Loads of Hay <hi>percipiend. annuatim,</hi> out of his Meadows in <hi>C.</hi> for 21 years: there the Grantee cannot ſtay and take all his Hay, and the Arrears of it in the later year; but he ought to take his Hay every year according to his Grant, <hi>Cauſa qua ſupra.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Leſſor here hath demanded more Rent than he ought, yet the Law ſhall conſtrue the demand good for ſo much of the Rent, which by the Law is demandable in point of forfeiture; as where a Man is bound to perform the Award of ſuch an one; who awards, That he and another ſhall be bound to another party for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, &amp;c. Although that the ſame Award be void as to the Stranger, yet it is good as to the party himſelf, and he ought to be bound by it. Dr. <hi>Mollins</hi> Caſe, A Leaſe for years rendring Rent to be paid at two days in the year; Proviſo, That if the ſaid Leſſee do not pay the ſaid yearly Rent, that then a Re-entry; that Rent is not demandable upon pain of forfeiture, but the laſt day of every year only, and not every year according to the Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The words of our Condition are; Provided, That if the Leſſee do grant his Term to his eldeſt Son, that he ſhall pay but ſo muſt Rent, the ſame without doubt is not any Condition; yet [he ſhall pay ſo much Rent] doth amount to ſo much. Note, In the Argument of this, this Caſe was put, <hi>A.</hi> is bound to make ſuch an aſſurance to <hi>B.</hi> of ſuch Land as <hi>C.</hi> ſhall deviſe; <hi>C.</hi> deviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That <hi>A.</hi> and his Wife ſhall make ſuch aſſurance, <hi>A.</hi> is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the peril of his Obligation to do it.

Court, If this were a good Cuſtom or not; The Iuſtices did forbear to deliver any Opinion in the Caſe: <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, That it was a void Cuſtom; for that the Law doth not take notice of Copyholders Eſtate, they being but Tenants at Will, in the Iudgment of the Common Law; and therefore it was not reaſonable, that their Wills and Pleaſures ſhould limit the Lord of the Mannor in granting of Eſtates by Copy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, ſuch a Cuſtom was void; and he compared it to the Caſe in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 27.

                  </p>
                  <p>To which the Defendant pleaded, That he was <hi>Conſiliarius &amp; in lege eruditus, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo juſtified. And now it was moved by <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> on the part of the Defendant, That by the Statute of <hi>18 Eliz. Cap. 5.</hi> That no Informer ſhall ſue any perſon upon any Penal Statute, but by way of Information, or Original Action, and not otherwiſe, And here the ſuit is by Bill, which cannot be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Statute. And he conceived, That this ſuit is brought upon the Statute of <hi>1 R. 2. cap. 4.</hi> upon which Statute, no proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhall be in the name of the ſubject only, but it may be in the name of the King only. <hi>See the Book of Entries, 393.</hi> Where the ſuit is, <hi>tam pro Domino Rege, quam pro ſeipſo:</hi> And there by the King only, and there by the party only. And as to the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8. cap. 9.</hi> ſuit upon the ſame ought to be, <hi>tam pro Domina Regina, quam pro ſeipſo:</hi> Which ſee in the <hi>Book of Entries, 395.</hi> Alſo by the Statute of <hi>31 Eliz. cap. 5.</hi> The ſuit brought, ought to begin within one year after the offence committed: And in our Caſe, the offence upon which the ſuit is conceived, was committed <hi>3</hi> years before the Information brought; and it cannot be added, becauſe that the Plaintiff is the party grieved; For every Statute made againſt Maintenance is Popular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Broughton</hi> ſaid, We have Replied to the Defendant, That he is a Lay Man, <hi>et non in Lege Eruditus;</hi> and prayed, that the ſame might be enquired of by the Country: And the Defendant <hi>Prince</hi> likewiſe, and ſo Iſſue is joyned: And becauſe you have ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, they ſhall be ſaved to you to move in Arreſt of Iudgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> I may offer them as well now to the Iury, as well as in Arreſt of Iudgment. And afterwards it was moved, That the Defendant might demur upon the Replication, if he would; and if not, the Iſſue ſhould be tryed: And if then it paſs againſt the Defendant, that then he ſhew the matter in Arreſt of Iudgment; for no Exception ſhall be allowed for ſtaying of the Enqueſt, if it be not an apparant fault, and not only a doubt.</p>
                  <p>At another day the matter was moved; and then it ſeemed to the Barons, That the Plaintiff here being <hi>Pars gravata,</hi> was not reſtrained to any year after the offence committed, but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint did extend only to Common Informers. The Defendant pleaded, That he was admitted <hi>in Societatem interioris Templi,</hi> and there remained a Student for ſo many years; And that he was

As, where the Ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth a Clerk for inſufficiency in learning, upon which they are at Iſſue, the ſame ſhall not be tryed by the Country, but by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: Which ſee <hi>Articuli Cleri, cap. 13. <hi>de Idonietate praeſentata ad Beneficium Eccleſiaſticum pertinet Examinatio ad Judicium Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> 40 E. 3. 25.</hi> And ſee the Statute of <hi>18 Eliz.</hi> that <hi>Pars gravata</hi> in the Caſe of Maintenance, is not tyed to a year.

                     <note place="margin">Ante 5, 6.</note> and <hi>Monſtrans de Droit;</hi> If the King be not enformed of all the Titles, all is void. And therefore in the Caſe between Sir <hi>Moyle Finch</hi> and <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> which now depends in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer;</hi> which was this, The Queen made a Leaſe for years rendring Rent, with a Proviſo, That if the Rent be behind, That the Eſtate ſhall ceaſe: the Rent is behind, the King granted the ſame over to Sir <hi>Tho. H.</hi> It was firſt moved, If the ſame Leaſe ſhould ceaſe without Office. And it was holden by <hi>Popham,</hi> and many other grave and learned Men, upon a Conference, That the ſaid Leaſe ſhould ceaſe without Office; for the Contract which is upon Record is determined and ceaſed, by which the Eſtate which was created by the ſaid Contract ſhall alſo ceaſe without Office. But yet the Leſſee continued in poſſeſſion notwithſtanding that, and took the Profits; but thereof after office found, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred recompence to the Queen: And it was holden there, upon the ſaid Conference, That the Queen in her Grant to Sir <hi>T.H.</hi> of the ſaid Eſtate which was now ceaſed, ought to recite that Leaſe; For the Tenant is in poſſeſſion, and could not be puniſhed for his occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation before Office. So in the Caſe of the Vicarage of <hi>Yatton, 17 Eliz. <hi>Dyer</hi> 339.</hi> The preſentment being devolved to the Queen by Lapſe, the Ordinary collated <hi>A.</hi> and afterwards the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99485:128"/>
Queen preſented <hi>B.</hi> who brought a <hi>Quare impedit;</hi> depending which, <hi>A.</hi> proved another Preſentment of the Queen, without mention or recital of the firſt Preſentment, and the ſame was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den void; For, in that, the firſt Preſentment is not recited, nor the pleaſure of the Queen to revoke it; and therefore it was in diſceit of the Queen. So the Caſe <hi>18 Eliz. <hi>Dyer</hi> 352.</hi> An Abbot leaſed for <hi>60</hi> years; the Leſſee made a Leaſe for <hi>80</hi> years, the Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came to the King; the <hi>60</hi> years expired, the ſecond Leſſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the King <hi>ea intentione,</hi> that the King would re-grant the ſame to him for <hi>20</hi> years remaining. The King reciting the Indenture and Surrender, <hi>ex certa ſcientia</hi> granted for <hi>20</hi> years: It was holden by the Court, That the Grant was void, becauſe the King was miſenformed, &amp;c. It hath been Objected, That here needs no recital; for that the Leaſe to be recited is ended, <hi>eo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante</hi> that the new Leaſe beginneth. <hi>Sed diſtinguenda ſunt tempora; aliud eſt facere, aliud perficere;</hi> the firſt Leaſe is ended, when the new is perfected, and the Great Seal put to it. The ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherefore the Leaſe ſhall be void, is, becauſe otherwiſe the Grant of the Queen ſhall enure to two Intents. <hi>1.</hi> To make a Leaſe. <hi>2.</hi> To accept a Surrender; and how can the Queen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Surrender of an Eſtate, of which ſhe hath not notice? for She is not enformed of it by any Record, without which She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take notice of any thing. <hi>See 7 E. 4. 30, 31. Baggotts</hi> Aſſiſe, The King granted an Office to an Alien, the ſame ſhall not enure to make him a Denizen, for then it ſhall enure to two intents, &amp;c. The words of the Grant of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> are, <hi>Omnia tenementa no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra;</hi> and, If by that a Reverſion ſhall paſs, was the Queſtion: Certainly, <hi>In verbis ambiguis Intentio ſumenda eſt;</hi> Then here in our Caſe, by this Patent, is other Land which ſhould paſs, and the Reverſion is <hi>noſtra;</hi> but in property, not poſſeſſion: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here <hi>(Noſtra)</hi> ſhall be reſtrained to that which is in poſſeſſion. Where there are general words in Grant of the King, they ought to be ſerved; but if they can be ſerved, they ſhall be taken in a common and general ſenſe; but the words ſhall not be ſtretched. But if they cannot be ſerved, then they ſhall not be void, but the King ſhall be rather prejudiced; and always the Grant of the King either may be ſerved or taken to a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>2 H. 3. 4. Quaelibet Conceſſio Domini Regis capi debet ſtricte contra Dominum Regem, quando poteſt intelligi duabus viis:</hi> As if two be joyntly endebted to the King, and the King pardons to one of them <hi>Omnia debita,</hi> the ſame ſhall not extend to joynt-Debts, but to thoſe Debts of which he is only Debtor, <hi>40 E. 3.</hi> The King granted to a Subject the Fines and Amercements <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ſuorum;</hi> All which hold of him by Homage, may be ſaid <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines ſuos;</hi> and alſo his Villeins are, <hi>homines ſuos;</hi> but becauſe the general words may be ſerved, the ſaid Grant ſhall be taken to extend to his Villeins only. So in our Caſe the general words may be ſerved with Lands in poſſeſſion, and ſhall not extend to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99485:129"/>
Lands in Reverſion. At another day the Caſe was argued by <hi>Popham</hi> Attorny General, and he conceived, That by the Leaſe made <hi>2 Mar.</hi> both the former Leaſes, as well that which was made by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, as that which was made in Reverſion by the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> are gone. Leſſee form term of years to begin at a day to come, accepts a new Leaſe in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to continue until the future Intereſt ſhall commence, the future Intereſt is gone; and in <hi>Barkings</hi> Caſe, <hi>2 Eliz.</hi> It was holden by <hi>Dyer</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> that where Leſſee for two years accepts a new Leaſe to begin two years after, this new Intereſt of a term determines the preſent Intereſt. For as the Leſſor cannot contract with a Stranger for the Intereſt of a Term, which is to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance during a former Term; by the ſame reaſon, when the firſt Termor will accept an Intereſt of a Term from his Leſſor to begin at any time during his former Eſtate, this new Intereſt determines the firſt. So, if one hath an Intereſt of a Term to begin at a day to come, and he before the beginning of that Intereſt accepts a Leaſe for life, his firſt Intereſt is gone. The words of the Patent are, All her Intereſt, Lands and Tenements, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> in <hi>Wells,</hi> and parcel of the poſſeſſion of the late Priory of <hi>R.</hi> and if theſe general words will carry Lands in Reverſion, where other Lands in poſſeſſion paſs, &amp;c. was the Queſtion. General words ſhall have a ſpecial underſtanding, if the ſpecial Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may agree with the proper ſignification and ſenſe of the general words, as the Caſe, <hi>2 H. 3 4.</hi> before cited; and yet in the Caſe of a common perſon, all manner of Debts were releaſed thereby, for that it ſhall be taken ſtrongeſt againſt the party: Alſo he conceived, That the Lands in Reverſion ſhould paſs as well as the Lands in poſſeſſion. And he ſaid, All former Leaſes of Record needed not to be recited. &amp;c. but ſuch Leaſes only which are made by the King; For Subjects may have Leaſes of Record, as by Fine, Deed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, &amp;c. but ſuch Leaſes need not to be recited; For ſuch Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may determine without matter of Record, as Surrender, Re-entry, &amp;c. and then to compel the King or the party to ſearch for ſuch Leaſes which might be ſo determined by any Act <hi>in pais,</hi> ſhould be as abſurd, as to compel him to ſearch by what means, and for what matter <hi>in pais</hi> ſuch Leaſes are determined. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, That this Leaſe needed not to be recited (which was made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>) For after the ſaid Leaſe made, the King granted the Reverſion to the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and his Succeſſors, and during the time that the ſaid Land was to the Biſhop; It might be, that the Leaſe was determined by matter in <hi>ſuit in pais,</hi> by Surrender, Forfeiture, &amp;c. and then, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the King obtained the Reverſion after, and will make a new Leaſe; if he ſhould be driven to recite the former Leaſe, whereas perhaps it is determined by an Act <hi>in pais,</hi> it ſhould be very inconvenient. Alſo here, if any recital ſhould be in the Caſe, how might the party intereſted know ſuch former Leaſes, but by
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99485:129"/>
ſearch? and how long ought the party ſearch? for his ſearch ought to have an end, <hi>Non excreſcere in infinitum tempus.</hi> And in our Caſe, the moſt equal time for ſearch is the beginning of the laſt Title of the King, and no further; that is, from the preſent time till the time of the Title of the King begins; and in this Caſe the Title of the King doth begin from his repurchaſe from the Biſhop; and if the Law be ſuch, then here nothing is to be recited; for no Leaſe is mean between the re-purchaſe and the new Leaſe: For no Leaſe made before the re-purchaſe, need to be recited. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, That King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> had made a Leaſe of a Mannor for <hi>500</hi> years, and afterwards granted the Reverſion to an Abbot, and afterwards the Mannor by ſuppreſſion came again to the King; and he will Grant a new Leaſe of the ſame, ſuch Leaſe ſhall be good without any recital of the Leaſe made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> for ſuch Leaſe might have been determined in the hands of the Abbot by Surrender, or other matter in fact. So King <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> made a Gift in Tail, and afterwards granted the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to another, the Grantee diſſeiſed the Tenant in Tail: One who was Heir to the Grantee, was attainted of Treaſon, the Grantee died, by which the Land came again to the King, who made a new Patent of the ſame, without recital of the Gift in Tail, and the Patent holden good for the Cauſe aforeſaid. And in ſome Caſes there needs no recital of Leaſes. As if the King makes a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent to his Receivor, and for default of payment, that his Eſtate ſhall ceaſe. Now if at the day the Leſſee tendreth the Rent, and the Receivor will not accept of it; and afterwards it is found by Office, that the Rent was not paid, by which the Leaſe ſhould be void (yet he may traverſe the Office;) and afterwards the King Grants this Rent to a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, there he needs not to recite the Leaſe; for it appeareth by the Office, That the ſame is void, and yet in truth the Leaſe was in <hi>Eſſe, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo a Leaſe of Record <hi>in Eſſe</hi> in ſome Caſe needs not to be recited. So if the King Leaſe for years to <hi>J.S.</hi> and he aſſigns his Intereſt over, and afterwards Surrenders the ſame to the King; Now if the King will make a new Grant of it, he need not recite that Leaſe; for the Surrender of it appeareth of Record, and the Aſſignment of it is but matter <hi>in fait,</hi> which cannot be known by any ſearch. So on the other ſide, void Leaſes which are not <hi>in Eſſe,</hi> ſhall be cited until it appear, as in the Caſe of <hi>Throgmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> cited before by <hi>Egerton;</hi> And in ſuch Caſe where the Queen granted the ſame to Sir <hi>T.H.</hi> the Grant ought to be in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not in Reverſion, becauſe then void, for the King had not a Reverſion. Alſo this Leaſe ought not to be recited, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Patent is granted to the firſt Leſſee; and ſo by acceptance of this new Leaſe, the firſt Leaſe is determined. And now we are to ſee, if the things in the former Grant are neceſſary to be recited, the Eſtate in the Land and the Tenant, not neceſſary; The Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Condition, Covenant, and the Date. The reaſon
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99485:130"/>
wherefore the Eſtate ought to be recited, is to this purpoſe, that the King might know, and be enformed how far the Land is encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with other Eſtates, &amp;c. but that reaſon is of no effect in our Caſe, when the ſecond Patent is made to the firſt Leſſee; for by the acceptance of the new Eſtate, the firſt Intereſt is gone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of that there needs no recital. The ſecond reaſon, wherefore ſuch former Leaſe ought to be recited, is to the intent, That the new Patentee may not have colour or countenance by reaſon of his Patent to do wrong to the firſt Patentee who hath the preſent poſſeſſion by diſturbing of him by Entry, or Suit; for all the truth of the matter appears in his own Letters Patents, and the true Eſtate of the Tenant in poſſeſſion: But that reaſon hath not any force in our Caſe; for the ſecond Eſtate is made to him, who hath the former Eſtate. The reaſon wherefore the preſent Tenant ought to be mentioned in the ſecond Letters Patents, is, ſo as the Queen may be aſcertained what manner of perſon he is, who is the preſent poſſeſſor; for it may be, he is ſuch to whom the Queen hath given ſuch Eſtate upon ſpecial favour for his good Service, and in recompence thereof; and that ſhe will not diſgrace the party ſo much, as to give his Farm to another over his head, which might be much to the diſcomfort and prejudice of him in poſſeſſion: which the Queen peradventure would not do, if ſhe had full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of it; but rather advantage him with it, and not let it to any other perſon. But in our Caſe here, there is not any ſuch matter of miſchief; But it is good to conſider what Tenant ought to be ſpecified in the Recital: Aſſuredly, the moſt ſure way is, the Patentee himſelf to whom the Leaſe was originally made; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be dead, or hath aſſigned his Intereſt over. For it may be dangerous to rely upon the Tenant, who hath the poſſeſſion; for it may be, that another hath the Intereſt, although he hath the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and then the recital is falſe; wherefore it is beſt to ſay by way of recital, <hi>Cum dimiſimus, &amp;c.</hi> And as to the Land, the ſame alſo ought to be recited by the ſame name in ſuch form, and by the ſame words as it was granted before in the former Grant; and yet if the name was miſ-recited in the former Grant, it ought not to be ſo in the ſecond. As if the King Grant the Mannor of <hi>Little-Court</hi> by the name of the Mannor of <hi>Litt-cote,</hi> or the Mannor of <hi>Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> by the name of the Mannor of <hi>Welton,</hi> the ſame is good by the Statute. But if a new Grant is to be made of the ſame, in which the firſt Grant is to be recited; now the former miſ-recital ſhall not be put in ure, but the very name; but in this ſpecial manner, that is, where the King hath demiſed the Mannor of <hi>Little-cote,</hi> by the name of the Mannor of <hi>Litt-cote, &amp;c.</hi> So where a Mannor is known by two names, and the Queen leaſeth the ſame by one of the ſaid Names, and afterwards Grants the ſame by the other name; The Recital ought to be, That whereas the Queen hath demiſed the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> by the name of the Mannor of <hi>S. &amp;c.</hi> And as to the recital of the Eſtate, the <hi>Habendum</hi> in the firſt Patent ought
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99485:130"/>
to be recited, and all that which preceeds the <hi>Reddendum;</hi> for, in that, the Eſtate is fully contained. But here, in our Caſe, ſuch recitals are not neceſſary; for it is impertinent to make recital of the ſame, which is determined <hi>eo inſtante,</hi> that the new Patent is made, and that by reaſon of a matter precedent, although that all be done <hi>eodem inſtanti;</hi> and as to an Inſtant, the ſame is not to be conſidered in Law, as it is in Logick, as a point of time, and no parcel of time. But in our Law, things which are to be done in an inſtant, have in conſideration of law a priority of time in them: As Leſſee for life makes a Leaſe for years, they both Surrender to him in the Reverſion; the ſame Surrender which is made in an inſtant, ſhall in Law be underſtood to have degrees. The Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Leſſee for years to the Tenant for life, and then the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of Tenant for life; So in our Caſe, the determination of the firſt Leaſe ſhall be firſt, <hi>1 E. 3. 6.</hi> The Tenant took the <hi>Seignioreſſe</hi> to Wife, had Iſſue, the Wife died; the Husband ſhall not be Tenant by the Curteſie; for, although the Seigniory was in him at the time of the Marriage, yet by priority in Law it ceaſed, ſo as no ſeiſin of the Seigniory was during the Coverture. So in our Caſe, <hi>eo inſtante</hi> that this new Patent is made, the firſt Eſtate is determined; yet in conſtruction of Law, the Surrender ſhall be ſaid precedent, and then the ſaid Eſtate needs not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. For if there had been an expreſs Surrender in fact, there had not been any doubt, that recital was not neceſſary; <hi>Ergo,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Caſe of a Surrender in Law. As to that which hath been Objected, That the Grant of the Queen cannot enure to two Intents; <hi>ſcil.</hi> to make a Surrender, and alſo to make a new Leaſe, The ſame Rule is true, where both Intents enure, and work againſt the King; But whereas the one Intent ſerves and works for the benefit of the King, it is otherwiſe: As in our Caſe, This Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render is for the benefit of the King; therefore it ſhall be taken, &amp;c. as <hi>6 H. 8.</hi> The King Grants Land to another, <hi>durante bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placito,</hi> and afterwards the ſame Patentee purchaſeth a new Eſtate from the King; here needs not any recital of the former, for the ſecond Eſtate is made to the firſt Patentee, and the firſt Eſtate is determined by the acceptance of the ſecond, <hi>3 Eliz.</hi> The Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Arrundel</hi> was this, The Lord <hi>John Gray</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leſſee for years of a Houſe called <hi>Hull-rake,</hi> of the Leaſe of the Queen, afterwards took a Grant from the Queen of the Cuſtody of the ſame Meſſuage, with a Fee for it, and that was without reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the former Leaſe, and the Grant holden good, and yet it did enure to two Intents; to a Surrender of the Leaſe, and a Grant of the Cuſtody, but both the Intents were not againſt the Queen, for the Surrender was for Her benefit. As to the Leaſe made <hi>13 Eliz.</hi> it is utterly void, for miſ-reciting of the date of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Leaſe made <hi>2 Mar.</hi> for the very date of the ſaid Leaſe was the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and in the Recital it is the <hi>21</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> For although the date is not neceſſary to be recited, yet here, as this
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99485:131"/>
Caſe is, the ſame ought to be truly recited. For the Surrender of the ſaid Eſtate which paſſeth by it, is the Conſideration of the new Grant; then, if the ſame be falſe, the Patent is void, for it was made by reaſon of that: for there is a more ample Leaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, than in truth it is by ten days. And ſo the Conſideration, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Surrender, not ſo beneficial as the Queen expected; alſo this new Patent doth contain in it ſelf a Grant of ſuch Lands as were demiſed formerly by Letters Patents, dated <hi>21</hi> of <hi>May, ſcil. Omnia praemiſſa, in forma praedict. dimiſſa,</hi> and nothing was demiſed <hi>in forma praedict. ſcil.</hi> by Patent bearing ſuch date; <hi>Ergo,</hi> nothing paſſed by the later Patent. For the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of <hi>13 Eliz.</hi> is in conſideration of a Surrender of a Leaſe made and bearing date <hi>21</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> whereas no ſuch Leaſe was, and then no Surrender, and then no Conſideration. Alſo here the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is falſe; for the Leſſee who is ſuppoſed to have ſurrendred his Leaſe, before the ſame Surrender aſſigned parcel of his Term to one <hi>Hagget,</hi> and afterwards purchaſed a new Leaſe in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Surrender of the former, and of his full Intereſt in it, whereas he had not the whole Intereſt; and ſo this falſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration deſtroys the whole Grant. For in all Caſes, where the conſiderations are real, and ſavour of the Land, or extend to ſuch a real thing; if it be falſe, it deſtroys the Patent: But where the conſideration is perſonal; as in conſideration of Mony paid, or for Service done, although it be falſe; yet the Patent may be good. So here, foraſmuch as the conſideration is real, in reſpect of this Surrender, and is falſe as appears before, the Patent is void: And as to this point, there is not any difference between Conſideration and Suggeſtion; for if it be real and falſe, the Patent is void; contrary, where perſonal. But in ſome Caſes where the Letters Patents are, <hi>Ex certa ſcientia, &amp;c.</hi> ſuch falſity in the reality ſhall not hurt. Which ſee <hi>18 Eliz. <hi>Dyer</hi> 352.</hi> So the Caſe between <hi>Manxel</hi> and <hi>Turvil,</hi> where Leſſee for years, his Leaſe being expired, ſuppoſing that he had twenty years of his Leaſe not entred; in conſideration of ſuch Intereſt, took a Patent <hi>de novo,</hi> the ſame was void. So <hi>Owens</hi> Caſe: <hi>Terril</hi> being Leſſee for years of the Parſonage of <hi>P.</hi> in the County of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> of the Grant of the King for certain years; In conſideration of his ſaid Intereſt, obtained a Grant of the Queen of Lands in <hi>Wales,</hi> whereas in truth he had before aſſigned his Intereſt in the ſaid Parſonage to another; and it was adjudged, That the ſaid Grant of Lands in <hi>Wales</hi> was void, for the Conſideration was void; and ſo the Conſideration being real, was falſe. And in ſome Caſes, a Conſideration perſonal, if it be falſe, ſhall deſtroy the Patent, if it be future and executory; as if the King Grants Lands to <hi>J.S. ea intentione,</hi> that he ſhall pay to <hi>J.D. 10 l.</hi> Now if he do not pay it, the Patent is void, and the Eſtate given by it void alſo. It hath been Objected by <hi>Godfrey,</hi> That by this Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, the Patent was cancelled, and ſo the parcel of the Term
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99485:131"/>
which was aſſigned to <hi>Hagget,</hi> was defeated and avoided, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Original Letters Patents out of which the Eſtate of <hi>Hagget</hi> was derived, are cancelled, and ſo there is a good Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and then the Conſideration is true; eſpecially, foraſmuch as <hi>Hagget</hi> being Aſſignee but of parcel of the Term, cannot have a <hi>Conſtat</hi> by the Statute of <hi>4 E. 6.</hi> As to that I conceive, That the Aſſignee of part of the Intereſt may have a <hi>Conſtat</hi> by that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, notwithſtanding the Surrender of the Letters Patents, and the cancelling of them; and for that matter the difference is, If the Roll remains a <hi>Conſtat</hi> may be, although that the Patent be cancelled. See <hi>Brook, <hi>Patents</hi> 89. 32 H. 8.</hi> If a <hi>Vacat</hi> be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Roll, then no <hi>Conſtat</hi> can be afterwards; and therefore in <hi>Sydnies</hi> Caſe, the Aſſignee could not have a <hi>Conſtat,</hi> becauſe there was a <hi>Vacat</hi> entred upon the Roll. But a <hi>Conſtat</hi> had before any <hi>Vacat</hi> entred upon the Roll; ſuch a <hi>Conſtat</hi> is good, notwithſtanding the <hi>Vacat</hi> afterwards: And it doth not appear, that any <hi>Vacat</hi> is entred upon the Roll; ſo for any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Hagget</hi> may have a <hi>Conſtat,</hi> and then his Intereſt is ſaved to him, and then the Surrender is void, and the Conſideration falſe; and although there be other Conſiderations in the Letters Patents, which are true and good, yet that ſhall not help the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For if any part of the Conſideration be falſe, the Patent is void in all; and ſo it was holden in <hi>Manxell's</hi> Caſe, cited before, and ſo be prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff. <hi>Egerton</hi> Sollicitor, to the contrary. Where the words <hi>ex certa ſcientia,</hi> are not put in Letters Patents; they ſhall be intended to be made at the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the Patentee, and ſo the Grant ſhall be taken beneficially for the King, and ſtrictly againſt the Patentee: But where ſuch words are put in the Letters Patents, there the Grant ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken beneficially for the Subject; Theſe words, <hi>Ex ſpeciali gratia,</hi> imply the bounty of the King, <hi>certa ſcientia</hi> excludes all ignorance, and <hi>mero motu</hi> ſhew the voluntary and liberal benevolence of the King, without ſuit of the party; and where the words in ſuch Letters Patents are general, they ſhall be conſtrued liberally for the Subject, but with limits and bounds, that nothing paſs in ſuch caſe, but ſuch things which are aptly ſignified by ſuch ſpecial words; as to paſs two things, where the meaning of the King was to paſs but one. And if the Patent be conceived <hi>utro<expan>

That the Leaſe made by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> is utterly void. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe the firſt Leaſe of Record is not recited. <hi>2.</hi> If the ſame ſhall be good, the Queen ſhould accept a Surrender, where ſhe knew not of it; and ſo the Patent ſhould enure to divers Intents. <hi>3.</hi> This Leaſe is made by general words; that is, Of all the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99485:132"/>
Lands in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Cuthberts:</hi> For theſe general words may be well ſatisfied with the Lands which the King hath in poſſeſſion; and therefore they ſhall not extend to the Lands which are now in Queſtion, of which the Queen at the time of the Grant had but a Reverſion; and firſt I conceive, That general words without any reſtraint or limitation, will paſs nothing: As, if the King pardons all Demands, or Grants <hi>Omnia terras &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nementa ſua;</hi> But, general words qualified with a reſtraint, where the Limitations are effectual; As, if the King Grants <hi>Omnia terras &amp; tenementa ſua</hi> in <hi>D.</hi> which he hath by the Attainder of <hi>J.S.</hi> or which were the poſſeſſions of ſuch diſſolved Monaſteries, ſuch Grants are good; And where the Caſe is, That Queen <hi>Mary</hi> hath the Lands in poſſeſſion, of the annual value of <hi>19 l.</hi> and other Land there in Reverſion of the annual value of <hi>6 l.</hi> and then ſhe Grants <hi>Omnia terras &amp; tenementa noſtra,</hi> rendring <hi>19 l. per annum.</hi> I conceive, That upon theſe words the Land in poſſeſſion only paſſeth, becauſe that the ſaid general words may be aptly ſerved and ſatisfied with the Lands in poſſeſſion, if no other Lands paſs. And I agree, That this word <hi>(Noſtra)</hi> extends as well to the Lands in Reverſion, as to Lands in poſſeſſion; but moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to Lands in poſſeſſion: for Land in Reverſion cannot <hi>dici ſimpliciter Noſtra,</hi> but <hi>quodam modo tanquam terra revertens,</hi> and not to take the natural profits of it; for the Termor hath ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, that he ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare clauſum fregit:</hi> But the intent and meaning of the Queen is to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that is the ſureſt way to have right intelligence of the Grants of the King; For here the Queen hath reſerved but <hi>19 l.</hi> Rent, which is the proper and ancient Rent of the Lands in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and if Lands in Reverſion ſhould alſo paſs, the Rent of which was <hi>6 l. per annum,</hi> then upon the whole Grant but <hi>19 l.</hi> being reſerved, the Queen ſhould loſe <hi>6 l. per annum</hi> of her ancient Rent; which ſhould be contrary to the intent and meaning of the Queen; and the intent of the Grantor, even in the Caſe of a Subject, ſhall direct the conſtruction of Grants. As <hi>9 H. 6. Br.</hi> Grants <hi>5</hi> by <hi>Babington.</hi> A Man grants Common in his whole Lands, he ſhall not have Common in his Orchards, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, or Meadows, for ſuch was the meaning of the Grantor, <hi>a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori</hi> in the Caſe of the King. It hath been argued, That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Leaſe ought not to be recited, becauſe that after the firſt Leaſe made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> the Inheritance hath been in a Subject, that is, the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells;</hi> but the ſame is not ſo: For if the King makes a Leaſe for years, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Grants the Reverſion upon Condition, which after is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo found by Office, by which the Reverſion is reduced to the King; If now the King will make a new Leaſe, he ought to recite the former Eſtate, notwithſtanding the mean grant of the Reverſion, or elſe ſuch ſecond Leaſe is void. Another matter hath been Objected, wherefore the former Leaſe ought not to be recited;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99485:132"/>
and that is, becauſe it is determined by ſurrender in Law, before that the new Leaſe takes effect; Sir, the ſame is not ſo, for the former Leaſe is in being, as the Caſe betwixt <hi>Fulmerſton</hi> and <hi>Steward, 1 Mar. Plow. Com. 106.</hi> upon the Statute of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>31 H. 8.</hi> See the words of the Statute, whereof and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any Eſtate or Intereſt for years at the time of the making of any ſuch Leaſe had his being or continuance. And an Abbot made ſuch a Leaſe to one, who had a term for years of a former Grant; although here be a Surrender, yet this Caſe is within the ſaid Statute, and the ſaid former Leaſe ſhall be ſaid to have his being at the time of the making of the later Leaſe; and the Surrender ſhall not be ſaid ſo to preceed the making of the Leaſe, but that the former Leaſe ſhall be ſaid <hi>in Eſſe</hi> at the time of the making of the later Leaſe. And in our Caſe, it ſhall not be taken for any Surrender, for then the Queen ſhall loſe <hi>6 l.</hi> of her ancient Rent and Revenue; and always when the Title of the King and of the Subject concur, the Title of the King ſhall be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as <hi>43 E. 3.</hi> The King Lord, Meſne, and Tenant; The Tenant pays his Rent at the day to the Meſne before Noon, and then the ſame day before Night the Meſne dieth, his Heir within age, the King ſhall be paid the Rent again; for here the Title of the King and the Subject concur together at one time, and in that the King ſhall be preferred; and ſo he prayed Iudgment for the Defendant. And afterwards at another day the Iuſtices declared their Opinions, and by <hi>Wray,</hi> Chief Iuſtice, We all agree, That the firſt Leaſe ought to be recited; and the reaſon which hath been urged againſt that point, hath reduced us to be of that Opinion, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That the ſecond Leaſe was made to the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee, and the King doth not make the recital; but the party ought to inform the King of all former Eſtates of the ſaid Lands; and that he might well do, for he is well knowing of them; and although that the Reverſion after the firſt Leaſe made hath been conveyed to a Subject, the ſame is not material here, foraſmuch as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Eſtate is made to him who had the firſt Eſtate, and might know whether the firſt Eſtate were determined or not; Alſo by the re-purchaſe, the King is in <hi>Statu quo prius. Gawdy</hi> Iuſtice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the former Term be drowned by the taking of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Leaſe; yet it was in being at the time of the taking of it, as it is holden by <hi>Bromley,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Fulmerſton</hi> and <hi>Steward.</hi> It is determined by the ſecond Leaſe, and yet it was in being at the time of the making of it. <hi>Fenner</hi> Iuſtice, to the ſame intent. <hi>Clench</hi> Iuſtice, If the Grant of the Queen ſhall enure to two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, then the Queen ſhould loſe <hi>6 l. per annum</hi> of her ancient Revenue. It was agreed by all the Iuſtices, That the general words in as much as they are reſtrained to a certainty would paſs the thing <hi>ſi caetera eſſent paria;</hi> contrary, if they had remained in the generalty; and afterwards Iudgment was given: <hi>Quod que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens nihil Capiat per Billam.</hi>

For the Vſe is created upon the Livery, and is transferred by the Statute, if the perſon to whom the Vſe is limited be capable of it at the time of the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but if not, the Law preſerves it until, and it cannot be by any means prevented; and he cited the Caſe, 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br.</hi> Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Vſes 50 and there is a great difference betwixt a Vſe limited before and after the Statute: For now after the Statute, the Feoffees by reaſon of their ſeiſin cannot be vouched; for they have not ſuch a Seiſin, whereof they may make a Feoffment, and he put the Caſe between <hi>Cheny</hi> and <hi>Oxenbridge; Cheny</hi> leaſed to <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> for 50 years, and afterwards enfeoffed <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> to the uſe of <hi>Cheny</hi> himſelf, and his Wife for their lives, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers remainders over; And it was adjudged in the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> That by the Feoffment the Term is not extinct; and he put the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Pagett,</hi> adjudged in the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi>

                  <p>TEnant in tail, and he in the Remainder in Fee joyn in a Grant of a Rent-charge in Fee, to the iſſue of Tenant in tail a year before the Statute of <hi>27 Eliz.</hi> of fraudulent Conveyances; and afterwards the Tenant in tail, and he in the Remainder ſell the Land; and afterwards a <hi>Praecipe</hi> is brought againſt Tenant in tail, who voucheth him in the Remainder, who voucheth the Common Vouchee, and ſo a Recovery is had, and ſeiſin according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; The iſſue in tail dieth without iſſue, Tenant in tail dieth, the Vncle diſtraineth for the Rent. <hi>Glanvil</hi> Serjeant argued, That this grant of the Rent is altogether the grant of the Tenant in tail, and that nothing paſſed from him in the Remainder; and that it doth enure as one entire Grant, and not as ſeveral Grants: As where Tenant for life, and he in the Reverſion joyn in a Leaſe; it is one entire Leaſe, and the Leaſe of them both; and they ſhall both joyn in an Action of Waſte. But admit that here are ſeveral
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99485:134"/>
Grants, yet the Eſtate out of which the Rent was granted, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the Rent, ſhall continue alſo: And now the Recoveror comes in the <hi>Poſt,</hi> and in the affirmation of the Eſtate of Tenant in tail; and the Remainder is utterly defeated and deſtroyed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and the Rent always iſſueth out of the particular Eſtate, and he cited, <hi>Littl. 125.</hi> If a Rent-Charge be iſſuing out of Land, and the Tenant of the Land leaſeth the ſame for life, and afterwards the Rent is granted over; now he who hath the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ought to attorn, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Tenant for life, for a Rent-Charge lieth always upon the poſſeſſion; and if Tenant for life grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Rent-Charge, and afterwards makes a Feoffment in Fee, the Rent ſhall continue until the poſſeſſion be recontinued, &amp;c. <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant contrary, This Grant is the Grant of them both, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of the Tenant as long he hath iſſue of his Body, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is the grant of him in the Remainder: Where a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives his Intereſt from two, the one being a particular Tenant, the other a Recoveror, or a Remainder in Fee; the Donee takes of each of them that which he may lawfully give, and no more; and the particular Eſtate being then ended, the Donee ſhall be then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted in by him in the Reverſion, &amp;c. See <hi>2 E. 4. 1.</hi> And he vouched the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> The Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> took to Wife a Woman Enheretrix, ſhe had iſſue, and ſo he was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to be Tenant by the Curteſie, and acknowledged a Statute, and afterwards he and his Wife levyed a Fine, and died; Now the Conuſee ſhall hold the Land diſcharged of the Statute; for after the death of the Husband, the Conuſee is in by the Wife only: and ſo paramount the charge. Alſo he ſaid, That this Grant of the Rent by the Father to the Son, is fraudulent, and ſo ſhall be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the contrary be not ſhewed and averred. And ſo it was of late adjudged in the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> Where a Man alieneth to his Son and Heir for Mony, (and Mony in truth is paid) yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſhall be intended fraudulent, unleſs the contrary be ſhewed and averred.</p>

And to this purpoſe, he put <hi>Newdegate's</hi> Caſe, <hi>7 Eliz. <hi>Dyer</hi> 234.</hi> Leſſee for life, and he in the Reverſion, Leaſe for years by Indenture, That during the life of Leſſee for life, is his Demiſe only, and the Confirmation of him in the Reverſion; but after the death of the Leſſee for life, it is the Leaſe and Demiſe of him in the Reverſion, and he ſhall have an Action of Waſte <hi>ex dimiſſione ſua propria,</hi> without ſhewing the ſpecial matter in the Count. And if Tenant in tail granteth a Rent in Fee, and he in the Reverſion confirm the Grant, it is good. <hi>See <hi>Litt.</hi> 121.</hi> And he ſaid, That the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veror is in the <hi>Per;</hi> for it was holden in <hi>Winter's</hi> Caſe, That if a Man makes a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent, with clauſe of Re-entry, and afterwards ſuffereth a Common Recovery, That

ſuch a Recoveror is an Aſſignee within the Statute of <hi>32 H.</hi> 8. to take benefit of a Condition; and Recoveries are now common Conveyances. And if Tenant for life be, the Remainder over in Fee, and Tenant for life grants a Rent-Charge, and afterwards ceaſeth, and the Lord recovereth in a <hi>Ceſſavit,</hi> he ſhall hold the Land charged. And as to the Colluſion, it is not ſhewed in the pleading, That the Grant was made by Colluſion: for if the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion be not apparent, the Iuſtices, without averment of it, are not bounden to take Notice of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cowper,</hi> Serjeant, Here are two ſeveral Grants, and one Grant intire in the Letter, may enure as ſeveral Grants, as if two Tenants in Common grant a Rent of <hi>10 s.</hi> here are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grants, and he ſhall have ſeveral Rents of <hi>10 s.</hi> And if <hi>A.</hi> diſſeiſeth <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Black-Acre,</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> diſſeiſeth <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>White-Acre,</hi> and afterwards by one Deed releaſeth to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> the ſame ſhall enure as ſeveral releaſes upon their ſeveral poſſeſſions. And he in his Argument relied much upon the Colluſion, and this Grant ſhall be taken by the Iuſtices to be fraudulent; for it was made <hi>20 Eliz.</hi> and the Recovery was <hi>21 Eliz.</hi> and in <hi>27 Eliz.</hi> came the Statute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beamount</hi> Serjeant, This Grant ſhall enure as ſeveral Grants; <hi>i.e.</hi> as a Grant of Tenant in tail, and afterwards as of him in the Reverſion: Two Ioynt-Tenants Enfants make a Feoffment, They ſhall have ſeveral Writs of <hi>Dum fuit infra aetatem,</hi> as upon ſeveral Feoffments. <hi>19 H. 6. 43.</hi> Two Coparceners take Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, who diſcontinue, and die; their Wives ſhall have ſeveral Writs of <hi>Cui in vita:</hi> and yet the Diſcontinuance was joynt.

And to that purpoſe, he cited <hi>Newdegate's Caſe, 7 Eliz. <hi>Dyer,</hi>
                     </hi> before cited. But <hi>poſito,</hi> that it be the ſole Grant of the Tenant in tail, yet here is not any <hi>Covin</hi> apparent; for <hi>Covin</hi> apparent ought to be averred and proved; otherwiſe the Iudges of our Law cannot adjudge upon it: for they cannot judge upon probabilities, as the Iudges of the Civil Law do; for ſo they ſhould many times mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Injuſtice in the place of Iuſtice: And, that the ſame is not <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> apparent, although it be made to his Son, he vouched <hi>19 H. 6. 30. and 47 E. 3. 16.</hi> Where ſuch a Feoffment to re-enfeoff the Heir of the Feoffor when he cometh of full age, is not in it ſelf <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> apparent, but it ought to be expreſly averred. And he cited al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Warnford's Caſe, 3 Eliz. <hi>Dyer</hi> 193.</hi> And alſo he cited <hi>17 Eliz. <hi>Dyer</hi> 341.</hi> upon the Statute of <hi>27 H. 8. of Monaſteries,</hi> Where there is a Proviſo, <hi>Foraſmuch as ſome of the Chief Governours of

                     <hi>Yelverton</hi> Serjeant, This is a joynt Grant; but yet it ſhall charge the ſeveral Eſtates when they come into poſſeſſion.

                  <p>And it was holden, That the party need not to make proof thereof within 6 Months, for it is not within the Statute, becauſe a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the ſame Parſon: But now a <hi>Conſultation</hi> was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the Agreement is ſhewed, but no Deed of it, which cannot be any diſcharge: But if it had been for a time; <hi>ſcil. unica vice,</hi> it had been good; but for life, not.

                  <p>THE <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>London</hi> brought an Action of Debt in the Mayors Court in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5 Co.</note> grounded upon an Act of <hi>Common Council.</hi> See <hi>C.</hi> 5 <hi>Part,</hi> The matter was removed into the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> by <hi>Corpus cum cauſa: Fleetwood,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> prayed a <hi>Procedendo.</hi> It was Objected, That they of <hi>London</hi> could not make Ordinances to bind the Subjects, as an Act of Parliament. To which, It was ſaid by <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> That the Cuſtom of the City is, That the Mayor and Aldermen, and four perſons choſen out of each Ward by the Communalty, may make Ordinances, which they call Acts of Common Council, and they ſhall bind every Citizen and Free-man, and all their Cuſtoms are confirmed by Act of Parliament, and by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which hath been confirmed 52 times; and alſo by the Statute of 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. For that King ſeiſed their Liberties, and drove them to pay for the Redemption of them 100000 Marks, and then the ſaid King confirmed them unto them for ever; and therefore this Ordinance being made according to our Cuſtom, ought not to be impeached: As in Caſe of matters of the Forreſt, If one be puniſhed for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt an Ordinance made for the governing of the Affairs of the Forreſt; you cannot remove the matter before you. So is the Law called <hi>Lex Idumaea,</hi> concerning Rivers and Fiſhing, in which are divers Ordinances, That none ſhall kill <hi>Salmons</hi> at certain Seaſons of the year, and ſo of other Fiſhes: If one be puniſhed by force of ſuch Law, he ſhall not be relieved here; for the Law of the Land hath always allowed ſuch particular Cuſtoms. And ſee <hi>F. B.</hi> If two Merchants put their Stocks together, and ſo Traffick together, and the one dieth, The Survivor ſhall not have the whole Stock, as the Common Law is, but the Executor of him that dieth ſhall have an Accompt againſt the other; and that is <hi>per Legem mercatoriam. Cook,</hi> to the ſame intent. This Act of <hi>Common Council</hi> is good, and according to the Law, that is, of Common Right. There are divers Statutes made for the true making of Cloth, and to take away the abuſes and deceit in the making of it, and this Act of <hi>Common Council</hi> is for the well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the ſaid Statutes; and I conceive, there is a difference in making of Laws by a Corporation; A Corporation may make an Act for the better executing of any Law eſtabliſhed at the Common Law, but new Laws they cannot make; As thoſe of a Town, who have uſed to have Common in certain Lands, they cannot make a By-Law, That ſuch a one in ſuch a Town ſhall not have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon there; but that none ſhall uſe his Common, but at ſuch a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99485:139"/>

A Town had Common of <hi>Turbary</hi> in a Marſh, and divers of the Inhabitants of the Town had made Trenches in the ſaid Marſh; and ſome had not a full Foot of Land in the Town, and ſuch perſons by their Trenches which they had made there, uſed to carry Turffs out of the ſaid Marſh by Boats, and ſell them, unto the value of 20 Marks <hi>per annum,</hi> to their great private profit, and to the great grievance of the others. For which cauſe, It was provided by common aſſent of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of the Lord of the ſaid Town, That all the Trenches in the ſaid Marſh ſhould be ſtopped, ſo as from thenceforth no Turffs be carried in Boats by the Trenches. And there it was holden, That if the greater part of the Commoners aſſent, the ſame ſhall bind the others who have not aſſented; for <hi>ubi major pars, ibi to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> And then, if ſuch Towns may make Laws; <hi>a fortiori,</hi> The City of <hi>London.</hi> Secondly, This Law is good by Cuſtom; for they have uſed to make ſuch Acts and Ordinances time out of mind, &amp;c. and theſe Cuſtoms are confirmed by Act of Parliament; and alſo they may appoint a penalty, for to what purpoſe otherwiſe ſhould they make an Act, <hi>Oderunt peccare mali formidine poenae.</hi> Alſo this Action is maintainable; for an Amercement in a Court Baron, an Action of Debt lieth. <hi>Gawdy</hi> Iuſtice, 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 19.<note place="margin">1 And. 234.</note> every one ought to aſſent. <hi>Wray,</hi> There the Ordinance made was to charge the Inheritance but here it is only to charge their Goods; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſent of the greater part is ſufficient.

And he ſaid, It was moved, <hi>20 Eliz.</hi> by <hi>Anderſon,</hi> in this Court, In Debt upon an Obligation againſt an Executor, The Defendants pleaded, That the Teſtator was endebted to one <hi>A.</hi> and that they had not more than to ſatisfie the ſame; And it was holden no plea; unleſs they had pleaded further, That a <hi>Scire facias</hi> was ſued forth upon the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Wray</hi> ſaid, That was not Law: And there is a difference when the Iudgment is given againſt the Teſtator himſelf, and where againſt the Executors: For where Iudgment is given againſt the Executors, the Iudgment which was firſt given, ſhall be firſt executed: But if two Iudgments be given againſt the Teſtator, he who firſt ſueth Execution againſt the Executors, ſhall he firſt ſatisfied, becauſe they are things of an equal nature; and before ſuit, it is in the Election of the Executor to pay which of them he pleaſeth. <hi>See 9 E. 4. 12.</hi> As if two Men have Tallies out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> he who firſt offers his to the Officer, ſhall be firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; for before that, it is in the Election of the Officer which of them he will pay. And a Iudgment is a higher Record, than a Statute; for the Statute is not a Record, but <hi>Debitum recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum recognitum</hi> And therefore, <hi>19 H. 6.</hi> If the Releaſe enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led be loſt, the Enrollment of it is not of any effect.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Paſch. 20 Eliz.</hi> Our very caſe was moved in the Court
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99485:142"/>
of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> In a <hi>Sire facias</hi> upon a Iudgment given againſt the Teſtator, the Executor pleaded, That the Teſtator had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a Statute before, not ſatisfied, <hi>ultra</hi> which, &amp;c. And it was holden no Plea; For a Statute is but a private and poquet-Record, as they then called it.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>32 Eliz.</hi> Between <hi>Coney</hi> and <hi>Barkham,</hi> the ſame Plea was pleaded, and holden to be no plea. Alſo, if this Plea ſhould be allowed, great Miſchief would follow; for then no Debts ſhould be ſatisfied by Executors; For it might be, that the Statute was made for performance of Covenants; which Covenants perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſhall never be broken. And afterwards, Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

And, that diſagreement to an Eſtate in ſuch manner veſted, may be <hi>in pais</hi> and by word, ſeems by a Clauſe in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>27 H. 8. cap. 1.</hi> Where a Ioynture is made after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, there the Wife after the death of her Husband may at her pleaſure refuſe her Ioynture, and have and demand, and take her Dower, her Writ of Dower, or otherwiſe; <hi>ſcil.</hi> by word, and Acceptance <hi>in pais.</hi> And if in a Writ of Dower, the Tenant will bar the Demandant, by Ioynture made during the Coverture, he ought to ſay, <hi>Quod intrando agreeavit.

                     </hi> If the Wife entreth and agreeth, the ſame is a good Bar in Dower, <hi>Littl. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the principal Caſe, When the Wife agreeth to the Deviſe of <hi>Thoby,</hi> and the ſame is executed by entry; now the ſame is a full Diſagreement to <hi>Hinton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was afterwards Objected, That although it be clear, That the Wife may waive her Ioynture in <hi>Hinton,</hi> by word and act in <hi>pais,</hi> without matter of Record; Yet ſome conceived, That this manner of Deviſe of <hi>Thoby</hi> is void by the Statute of <hi>32 &amp; 34 H. 8.</hi> The Statute enables to Deviſe two parts, or ſo much as
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:99485:143"/>
amounts to two parts in value at the time of the death of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor, for then the Will takes effect; which cannot be here in this Caſe; for at the time of his death the Ioynture of <hi>Hinton</hi> was in force, and ſo continued, until the diſagreement after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the words of the Statute are, <hi>Having a ſole Eſtate in Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple;</hi> but here the Deviſor had but a Reverſion in Fee expectant upon an Eſtate tail, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt Point, it was anſwered, That the Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth relate to the death of the Husband, and is now, as if no Ioynture had been made <hi>ab initio.</hi> And here the Heir ſhall have <hi>Hinton</hi> by deſcent, and he ſhall be Tenant to every <hi>Praecipe;</hi> and if it be brought againſt him the ſame day that the Husband dieth, the Writ ſhall be good by the Diſagreement after, and the Heir ſhall have his age, &amp;c. And if the Father had been a Diſſeiſor, and had Conveyed the Land, <hi>ut ſupra;</hi> now by this argeement of the Wife, the Heir ſhall be accounted in by deſcent, and thereby the Entry of the Diſſeiſee taken away.</p>
                  <p>And if the Heir in ſuch caſe taketh a Wife, and dieth, by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement after, the Wife ſhall have Dower of <hi>Hinton;</hi> and hath ſuch a poſſeſſion, <hi>quod faciet ſororem eſſe haeredem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if that the ſame day that the Husband dieth, the Heir levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Fine, or acknowledge a Statute; or maketh by Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enrolled a Bargain and Sale of it; by the ſaid agreement, <hi>Hinton</hi> ſhall be ſubject to ſuch Acts of the Heir. All which Caſes prove, That the Deviſor upon this matter at the time of his death, had a ſole Eſtate in Feeſimple in the Mannor of <hi>Hinton;</hi> and that the third part in value deſcended to the Heir: and ſo the Deviſe of <hi>Thoby</hi> good.</p>
                  <p>It hath been Objected, That here is not an immediate deſcent of which the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> ſpeaks; And here the Mannor of <hi>Hinton</hi> doth not deſcend immediatly; for there was a mean time between the Death, and the Diſagreement; and ſo the Will void for <hi>Thoby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that it was anſwered, That this word, <hi>[immediatè] ſumitur dupliciter, re, &amp; tempore,</hi> and ſhall be taken here <hi>immediatè re &amp; ſtatu, ſcil.</hi> That a Reverſion, or a Remainder dependant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular Eſtate in poſſeſſion which is mean, ſhall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the third part deſcended; For a Deſcent which takes away an Entry, ought to be immediate; for a mediate deſcent doth not take away an Entry, <hi>Litt. 92.</hi> as the deſcent of a Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Remainder.</p>
                  <p>And if this word <hi>[Immediatè]</hi> had not been in the Statute, Then the Statute might have been conſtrued, That it ſhould be ſufficient to leave the third part to deſcend in Reverſion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; but this word <hi>[Immediatè]</hi> makes it clear. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the third part which deſcends, ought to deſcend <hi>immediatè in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:99485:144"/>
re, &amp; Statu.</hi> Yet a Reverſion upon a Leaſe for years, or for life, with the ancient Rent reſerved, is ſufficient, and is a good and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate deſcent of the third part.</p>
                  <p>And this word here <hi>[immmediatè]</hi> to be conſtrued <hi>ratione tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> is a frivolous Conſtruction; for the wore, <hi>Deſcent,</hi> implys that; For there cannot be an expectant and future deſcent; For deſcent is clearly immediate without mean time. But here in this caſe, the word, <hi>immediate,</hi> is to be taken in both ſenſes, <hi>et re, et tempore;</hi> For by the Relation of the <hi>Waiver,</hi> it is, as if no Ioynture had been made, and the Heir is to have the profits of the Land from the death of his Anceſtor: And ſo the deſcent of <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton immediatè, et re, et tempore;</hi> And, that the ſame time hath had ſuch reaſonable Conſtruction, is now to ſee: The Statute of <hi>18 H. 6 Cap. 1. is,</hi> That the Chancellor ſhall make Patents to bear date the ſame day that the Warrant was made, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>It hath been taken, That if the Patents bear date after the Warrant entred, they are good. <hi>Which ſee, 19 Eliz. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 492. in <hi>Ludford</hi> and <hi>Gretton</hi>'s Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Statute of <hi>Acton Burnel</hi> is, That if the Extendors extend the Land too high, <hi>ſtatim reſpondeant illi qui fecerunt extent.</hi> This word of time <hi>(ſtatim)</hi> ſhall not be conſtrued, that the Extendors ſhall pay preſently, but that they ſhall pay without delay; <hi>i.e.</hi> at the day limited in the Statute. <hi>See 2 H. 4. 17, 18.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been Objected, That it is a great inconvenience, that the King for his third part ſhould attend the pleaſure of the Wife, the time of her Election; and therefore the Will ſhall be void.</p>
                  <p>But the ſame is no inconvenience, for the Ioynture never was actually in the Wife, to her prejudice, until ſhe entred into the Land, &amp;c. And now by the <hi>Waiver,</hi> the Ioynture is avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>ab initio</hi> to all intents, as if it never had been made: So as the King ſhall be anſwered of the entire profits after the time of the death of the Husband; and may ſeize the whole Land pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, without ſtaying the Election of the Wife, or taking notice of her Ioynture.</p>
                  <p>And ſo are the words of the <hi>Diem clauſit Extremum; Tibi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipimus quod omnia Terras &amp; Tenementa,</hi> of which, &amp;c. <hi>et ea ſalvò Cuſtodias donec aliud tibi praeceperimus;</hi> And that may be before any Office found: And thoſe who have any Intereſt in the Land, or otherwiſe may ſhew the ſame upon the Traverſe of the Office, or in the <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> and have allowance of it; And ſo there is not any prejudice to the King: No more, than when Tenant in Knight-ſervice Deviſeth all his Lands, There Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is to be made, and the King hath not any prejudice by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:99485:144"/>In the true Conſtruction of this Statute, it is very neceſſary to conſider the intention and meaning of both Statutes. And it is certain, That the ſaid Statutes were made for the benefit of the Subjects, to enable them to diſpoſe of their Lands for the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Wives, advancement of their Children, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Debts, whereof they were reſtrained by the Statute of <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> of <hi>Uſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Savings in the ſaid Statute are for the benefit of the King and the Lords; So as Proviſion is made not only for the benefit of the Subjects, but alſo for the profit of the King and other Lords.</p>
                  <p>The diſability of the ſubjects to diſpoſe of their Lands, to the intents aforeſaid, appears in the Preface of the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the favour and grace of the ſaid King towards his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to ſupply the neceſſity of Subjects, appeareth by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of both Statutes.</p>
                  <p>The later Statute, is an Explanation of the former in divers Points.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Statute to perſons, <hi>Having Mannors, &amp;c. <hi>Ex vi termini,</hi>
                     </hi> includes Tenants in tail, Ioynt-Tenants, Enfants, Idiots, Feme-Coverts; but the ſame is explained by the later Act, to be of Feeſimple only, and of ſole Eſtates, and to perſons of ſound memory, not of Coverture. And ſo, If the Kings Tenant Deviſeth all his Land, the ſame is good for two parts of it; ſo if he Deviſe all which he hath in Feeſimple, and leaveth the third part to deſcend in tail.</p>
                  <p>This Statute ſhall be taken ſtrict againſt the Heir: For the whole Scope and Intent of the Parliament was, to bind the Heirs, and to enable their Fathers to diſpoſe, ſo as the third part be ſaved to the King and the Lords. And that is manifeſt, For the Eſtates made by Colluſion are preſerved, and by an expreſs Clauſe in the Statute kept in force againſt the Heir; but void as to the Lords.</p>
                  <p>As to certain <hi>Readers</hi> Caſes, which have been put to prove, That theſe Statutes ought to have a ſtrict Conſtruction, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>Nihil operatur.</hi> A Man ſeiſed of one Acre by Diſſeiſin, and of two Acres by good Title, all holden in chief by Knight-ſervice, Deviſeth the two Acres which he hath by good Title, and dieth, ſo as the Acre which he hath by Diſſeiſin deſcends to the Heir being within age; the King ſeiſeth, the third Acre is deveſted by <hi>Eigne</hi> Title; the Deviſe of the other two Acres is good againſt the Heir; for it is within the expreſs words of the Statute, <hi>Having a ſole Eſtate in Fee-ſimple.</hi> And yet by another Branch of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi> the King for his time, ſhall have recompence out of the other two Acres; and he agreed the Law to be ſo: but the ſame doth not conclude our Caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:99485:145"/>A Man ſeiſed of two Acres in Socage, and of one Acre holden by Knight-ſervice in Chief of equal value, is diſſeiſed of the Acre holden in Chief, and Deviſeth the other two Acres in Fee, the ſame is a good deviſe; for it is within the firſt branch expreſly, Having a ſole Eſtate in Feeſimple, and not having any Lands holden by Knight-ſervice; for during the diſſeiſin, he hath not the Land whereof he was diſſeiſed, and therefore the deviſe is good for the benefit of the Deviſee, and the Lord is not at any Miſchief: For the Diſſeiſee notwithſtanding the Diſſeiſin, remains Tenant of the Lord as to the Avowry, and the Lord ſhall have the Wardſhip of ſuch Heir, and may enter upon the Diſſeiſor, and ſo have a third part. And that Caſe was put out of <hi>Gilbert's</hi> Reading.</p>
                  <p>A Man ſeiſed in Fee of two Mannors of equal value holden by Knights-ſervice in <hi>Capite;</hi> and a third Mannor of the ſame value is conveyed to him by Deed of Bargain and Sale acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; and before Enrollment, he deviſeth the two firſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to <hi>J.S.</hi> in Fee, and dieth; and afterwards the Indenture is enrolled; yet the deviſe is not good for the ſaid two Mannors by any Relation of the Bargain and Sale enrolled. That Caſe may well be agreed to be Law; For the Eſtate doth not veſt in the Vendee before Enrollment, and ſo the Eſtate was not perfectly in the Deviſor at the time of the Will; For although that the Enrollment ſhall relate to prevent all acts and charges made mean by the Vendor; yet it ſhall not relate to veſt the Eſtate, from the time of the delivery of the Deed, For the Vendee cannot puniſh a Treſpaſs Mean; And if the Vendee hath a Wife, and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee dieth before Enrollment, and afterwards the Deed is enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhe ſhall not be endowed: but here ſhall be ſome deſcent to take away an Entry, yet the Heir ſhall have his age. But in our Caſe, it is otherwiſe; for by the Waiver, the Ioynture was wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>ab initio.</hi>

And the King was not entituled to <hi>Livery</hi> or <hi>Primer Seiſin:</hi> And therefore the Defendant was diſmiſſed. But peradventure the Queen ſhall have benefit of the Act. <hi>See Cook 3 Part, 30, 31. <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi>'s Caſe.</hi>

                  <p>Tenant in tail of an Acre of Land holden of the King in Chief by Knight-ſervice, ſeiſed of two Acres in Fee, holden, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> makes a Leaſe for three Lives of the Acre entailed, reſerving the accuſtomed Rent, and afterwards deviſeth the other two Acres in Fee; and afterwards dieth ſeiſed of the Reverſion and Rent; The ſame is a good deviſe of all the two Acres: And here is an immediate deſcent of the third part, for the ſame is within the words, <hi>In Poſſeſſion, Reverſion or Remainder,</hi> or any Rent or Service incident to any Reverſion, or any Remainder. See the Statute of <hi>34 H. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Man ſeiſed of three Acres of equal value holden by Knight-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in <hi>Capite,</hi> aſſureth one to his Wife for her Ioynture by Act exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; and deviſeth another to a ſtranger, And the third to his Wife alſo; The King in this caſe ſhall have the third part of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Acre: But if the ſtranger waiveth the deviſe, the King ſhall have the Acre to him deviſed, and the Wife ſhall retain the other two Acres, and it ſhall not go in advantage of the Heir. So if he deviſeth the ſaid three Arces ſeverally to three ſeveral perſons, to each of them one Acre, and the one Waives the deviſe in one Acre, The deviſe of the other two is good; Or otherwiſe, the King ſhall have the third part of every Acre, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>It was moved, What ſhould be done in this Caſe, and how the party ſhould be diſcharged of the Execution; for the authority of the Adminiſtrator is now determined, and he cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſatisfaction, or make an acquittance.</p>
